Athena
======

The Athena GTK3 File Manager for SolusOS

Origins
-------
Athena is a fork of Nautilus 3.4.2. It includes all of the SolusOS Nautilus patches as the base for the fork

Rationale
--------
SolusOS 2 is based on Debian Wheezy which currently ships Nautilus 3.4.2 in it's repositories. So far we have
taken the approach of patching Nautilus and pinning it at a higher priority in the repos. However having to
play chase with every change to the Nautilus package in the repos (and related packages) quickly makes it a
tiresome process. To protect ourselves from future changes, and the fact that Nautilus 3.5/3.6 is taking a totally
different direction, we start out fork from 3.4.2

Stop Forking!
-----------
A fork usually pops into existence when a group of people or a developer becomes unhappy with the original product/project.
Unless the new fork addresses the issues, more and more forks will pop into existence further diluting the product until
its a pretty bad mess.
Instead of me contributing and reworking patches to different projects and repos, I'll keep all the work in one project
which will be developed separately from Nautilus.

Flagship?
--------
Athena will be the flagship File Manager of SolusOS 2.

Requests/Bugs
-----------
Report bugs to myself on the commits or via the SolusOS IRC (irc.silverirc.com/#SolusOS). Feel free to make requests
but "dumbing down", removals and Shellification/Unitification won't be happening. The whole reason for forking is to maintain
a powerful yet good looking file manager.
