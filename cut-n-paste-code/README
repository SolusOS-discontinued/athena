README for athena/cut-n-paste-code

The code in this directory hierarchy was cut-n-pasted from 
somewhere else.

In the soon to come, Star Trek future, this code will be available
as part of standard libraries.

For example, the code in libegg will be one day available as part
of Gtk+.

Until that happens, DON'T HACK the code, unless you are updating 
from the original cut-n-paste source.

Instead of hacking the code in cut-n-paste-code, create subclasses 
and put them in libathena-extensions.

If you have any specific questions, comments or complaints about this
setup, send mail to the athena mailing list at:

athena-list@gnome.org
