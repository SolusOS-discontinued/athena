	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/Makefile.am:

	Libtrilobite now needs gnome-vfs -- oops.

2000-08-31  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	* components/services/summary/lib/eazel-summary-shared.c:
	(parse_a_service), (parse_a_eazel_news_item),
	(parse_a_update_news_item):
	* components/services/summary/lib/eazel-summary-shared.h:

	Adding the rest of the xml parser.	

2000-08-31  Robey Pointer  <robey@eazel.com>

	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/Makefile.am:
	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/trilobite-core-utils.c
	: (trilobite_close_log), (trilobite_open_uri),
	(trilobite_fetch_uri), (trilobite_fetch_uri_to_file):
	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/trilobite-core-utils.h
	:

	Add trilobite_fetch_uri() and trilobite_fetch_uri_to_file() to the
	core utils in libtrilobite.  This makes it easy to use gnome-vfs
	to fetch a remote file into a buffer (hint: XML).
	
	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/trilobite-redirect.c:
	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/trilobite-redirect.h:

	Fetch the url redirection table from an XML file on the server and
	store it in gconf for other views to use.
	
	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/trilobite-root-client.
	c: (trilobite_root_client_initialize):

	Clarify the FIXME.

2000-08-31  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* components/tree/athena-tree-expansion-state.c:
	Made the tree view expansion state preference use a full gconf
	path so it's not coupled to user level.

2000-08-31  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-throbber.c: (select_throbber_image),
	(athena_throbber_load_images):
	made the throbber throb in the intended direction (clockwise); the
	problem was caused by prepending to the image list, which was reversing
	their order - fixed by making it append instead.
	
2000-08-31  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	* components/services/summary/lib/eazel-summary-shared.c:

	(athena_rpm_view_initialize),
	(athena_rpm_view_update_from_uri), (athena_rpm_view_get_uri),
	(athena_rpm_view_verify_package_callback):
	moved the details back here; added an accessor for the uri field;
	added a verify button; changed label info text back to using non-aa
	text, since aa-text doesn't justify right yet; captured images
	from the header if present.
	* components/rpmview/athena-rpm-view-install.c:
	(athena_rpm_view_install_done),
	(athena_rpm_view_install_package_callback):
	used the new accessor for uris.
	
2000-08-31  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-gtk-extensions.c:
	(finish_button_activation): Little bitty code cleanup.

2000-08-31  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1699, get help stuff to render in mozilla.
	
	* components/mozilla/main.c: (main):

	milestone.

	* check-FIXME.pl: Make the script a little
	bit smarter about recognizing FIXMEs with
	bug reports.

	* src/athena-search-bar-criterion.c:
	* src/athena-search-bar-criterion.h:
	* src/athena-search-bar-criterion-private.h:	
	(athena_search_bar_criterion_destroy),
	(athena_search_bar_criterion_new), (option_menu_callback),
	(athena_search_bar_criterion_set_callback),
	(athena_search_bar_criterion_new_from_values),

	* libathena-extensions/Makefile.am:
	* src/Makefile.am:
	moved search bar criterion class out of 
	libathena-extensions and into /src
	Added acceptance of the emblems changed signal, which
	causes a redraw of an emblem criteria menu.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory.c:
	(athena_directory_destroy), (construct_private_metafile_vfs_uri),
	(athena_directory_new):
	Changed the name of metafile_vfs_uri function from
	metafile_uri to reflect its return of a gnome vfs uri.
	Check for the case where the metafile was not successfully 
	created when freeing.

	* src/athena-complex-search-bar.c: (criterion_callback):
	got rid of extraneous print statement.
	
	* src/athena-property-browser.c: (remove_emblem),
	(emblem_dialog_clicked), (emit_emblems_changed_signal):
	Added the emission of signals that happen when the list of 
	emblems change so that we tell the search bar about it.
	
	* src/athena-signaller.c: (athena_signaller_initialize_class):
	* src/athena-signaller.h:
	Added an "emblems changed" signal to the signaller's vocabulary,
	since we need a global signal, so this seems to be the logical
	object to attach it to.

2000-08-31  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2013 (Enter should start complex search when any
	search text field has focus)

	* libathena-extensions/athena-gtk-extensions.c:
	(athena_gtk_button_auto_click): Now checks for insensitive
	state and does nothing in that case.
	
	* src/athena-complex-search-bar.c:
	(athena_complex_search_bar_initialize):
	Made find button get created before criteria widgets.
	(attach_criterion_to_search_bar): Wire up "activate"
	signal for text field to auto_click the find button.
	* src/athena-simple-search-bar.c:
	(athena_simple_search_bar_initialize): Now the
	"activate" signal for the one text field here calls
	auto_click on the button instead of calling a separate
	callback that checks button sensitivity (indirectly) and 
	then starts search. Watch the button depress as if by magic! 
	Impress your friends!

2000-08-31  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1037 (Use "folder" instead of "directory" consistently)

	I think I found them all. If you find any others, fix them or
	write up new bug reports about them.

	(format_item_count_for_display), (athena_file_dump):
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:

	and "directories" in the UI with "folder" and "folders"
	
	* src/athena-window-menus.c: (athena_window_initialize_menus):
	* src/athena-window-private.h:
	* src/athena-window-toolbars.c: Same as above. Also moved the
	hint strings used by both toolbar buttons and menu items into
	a shared header file instead of duplicating them.

	Athena universe.
	
2000-08-31  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-toolbar.c: (athena_toolbar_size_allocate):
	fixed bug 2628, merged toolbar items appear after throbber, by
	saving and restoring the current position around the positioning
	of the throbber.
	
2000-08-31  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Converted more preferences to not be coupled to user level,
	following up on Ramiro's change to make this possible. Note
	that some of your preferences might experience a one-time
	change after this checkout (most noticeably the sidebar width).

	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.c:
	(global_preferences_register): Removed default values for
	sidebar width.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.h:

	ATHENA_PREFERENCES_SHOW_BUILT_IN_BOOKMARKS, and 
	ATHENA_PREFERENCES_SIDEBAR_WIDTH to the non-user-level-coupled
	section, and gave them full gconf paths.
	Added clarifying comment to ATHENA_PREFERENCES_SIDEBAR_PANELS_NAMESPACE.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	Removed mysterious semicolon that was the first character in the file.
	(fm_directory_view_initialize), (fm_directory_view_destroy):
	Update for name change of ATHENA_PREFERENCES_ICON_CAPTIONS.
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-text-window.c:
	(changed_attributes_option_menu_callback),
	(create_icon_text_window), (fm_icon_text_window_destroy_callback),

	Update for name change of ATHENA_PREFERENCES_ICON_CAPTIONS.
	
	* src/athena-window.c: (athena_window_initialize): Teensy
	comment clarification.

2000-08-31  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2327 (Alt-key shortcuts to navigate menus shouldn't
	work on Desktop). Control-key shortcuts to invoke items directly
	still work. I had to fix a Bonobo bug to make this work, so
	until you get a new Bonobo this won't work for you (but it will
	still compile and run and all).

	* src/athena-window.h:
	Prototype for athena_window_disable_keyboard_navigation_for_menus.
	
	* src/athena-window-menus.c: Added normal_menu_titles, a static
	array of menu paths used for iterating across all the textual
	menu titles.
	(get_menu_title): New function, returns menu title given path.
	(remove_underline_accelerator_from_menu_title): New function,
	resets the label of a menu to be the same, but without the underline.
	(athena_window_disable_keyboard_navigation_for_menus): New function,
	iterates through normal_menu_titles calling remove_underline_... 
	on each.
	(new_top_level_menu): Now computes title from path using get_menu_title
	instead of taking title as parameter.
	(athena_window_create_top_level_menus): New function, creates all
	the top-level menus (other than weird user level one) by iterating
	across normal_menu_titles.
	(athena_window_initialize_menus): Now calls _create_top_level_menus
	instead of creating each one at a time.

	* src/athena-desktop-window.c: (athena_desktop_window_new):
	Now calls athena_window_disable_keyboard_navigation_for_menus
	just after creating the AthenaWindow.

2000-08-31  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-about.c: (athena_about_initialize),
	(athena_about_draw_info):
	draw the passed-in comment in the appropriate position. This change
	completes the new about dialog.
	* src/athena-window-menus.c: (help_menu_about_athena_callback):
	tweaked the about window comment and authors.
	
2000-08-31  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-about.c: (athena_about_initialize):
	fixed bug 2653, about window crashes if shown more than once.
	Fixed by setting the "close_hides" boolean.  Also, set the
	title of the window to "About Athena".
	
2000-08-31  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Bug 1293.  Core dump if gconf returns bad values
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-user-level-manager.c:
	(athena_user_level_manager_get_user_level):
	Add blurb explaining why its ok to trust the returned string.
	This was actually fixed by komrade Jirka's last checkin to this
	file.
	
2000-08-31  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-window-menus.c: 
	(athena_window_initialize_menus): Use
	gtk_signal_connect_while_alive() for user_level_changed_callback
	so that we dont get callbacks after we are dead.

2000-08-31  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Task 1229.  Need support for preferences not coupled to user level.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.c:
	(global_preferences_register):
	Add FIXME for the issue of setting default values for non user
	level specific preferences.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.h:
	Add blurb explaining preferences that are user level specific and
	those that arent.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-preferences.c:
	(preferences_hash_node_add_by_user_level_callbacks),
	(preferences_hash_node_add_callback),

	(preferences_make_make_gconf_key),
	(preferences_gconf_by_user_level_callback),

	coupled to the user level.

	(athena_preferences_set_boolean),
	(athena_preferences_get_boolean),
	(athena_preferences_set_string_list),
	(athena_preferences_get_string_list),
	(athena_preferences_set_enum), (athena_preferences_get_enum),
	(athena_preferences_set), (athena_preferences_get):
	Add support for preferences that are not coupled to the user
	level.  Compute gconf keys by taking the preference name into
	account.  If it begins with a "/" (indicating it is fully
	qualified) then treat it as a regular gconf key and use it as is.
	 Otherwise, use the user_level_manager to compute a key according
	to the current user level.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-preferences.h:
	Add documentation explaining the two different ways to specify
	preference names depending on whether they are user level specific
	or not.

	* src/athena-first-time-druid.c: (set_http_proxy):
	Use the non user level specific perferences support instead of
	poking gconf directly.
	
2000-08-31  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* athena-installer/src/evil.xpm:
	Forget the evil xpm for failed operation.

	(eazel_install_fetch_rpm_dependencies):
	Revamped a lot to prevent multiple downloads of the same file (bug
	2643), as the installer revealed some easy ways to trigger
	that. Basically, I no longer handle each category individually,
	but flatten the list. Also handles package-list xml's with
	dependency trees.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-xml-package-list.c:
	(parse_category), (osd_parse_implementation), (osd_parse_softpkg):

	Added some funky xml parsing so you can control category
	dependency via a xml file.

	invoked athena_about instead of gnome_about
	update the list of authors and other info
	
2000-08-31  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2446, need to implement CDROM ejection.
	It's in there.  Let's see what breaks.
			
	* src/athena-window.c: (athena_window_initialize_class):	
	(realize):
	Added a new hint for sawfish and removed a focus flag at the
	reccomendation of John Harper.
	
2000-08-30  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2393 (need cleaner way for directory view subclasses
	to insert menu items)

	I'm going to be futzing with directory view context menu items
	soon, so I started by cleaning up the architecture a little to
	make future futzing easier.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.h:
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: 
	(set_menu_item_path): New function, stores the menu's path 
	identifier in the GtkMenuItem (via set_data) so that it can
	be compared against later.
	(menu_item_matches_path): New function, checks whether a menu
	item's stored path matches a specified one.
	(fm_directory_view_add_context_menu_item): Renamed this function
	from fm_directory_view_add_menu_item for clarity, and gave it
	a path parameter so callers could specify the path by which the
	item can later be identified. Calls set_menu_item_path with
	path.
	(append_gtk_menu_item_with_view): call set_menu_item_path.
	(real_create_background_context_menu_zoom_items),
	(fm_directory_view_real_create_background_context_menu_items):
	Update for fm_directory_view_add_context_menu_item change.
	(add_open_with_gtk_menu_item): Add comment about lameness that I
	will fix soon.
	(fm_directory_view_get_context_menu_index): Reimplement using
	menu_item_matches_path instead of hardwiring indices that could
	easily get out of synch with actual menu-creation code (and were
	in fact out of synch). Added a GtkMenu parameter as part of this.

	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_create_background_context_menu_items):
	Update for fm_directory_view_add_context_menu_item change.

	(real_create_selection_context_menu_items): Update for
	fm_directory_view_get_context_menu_index change.

2000-08-30  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-throbber.c: (get_throbber_dimensions),
	(athena_throbber_initialize):

	* libathena-extensions/athena-string.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-string.c:
	(athena_str_strip_chr), (athena_str_double_underscores),
	(athena_str_middle_truncate): Use g_new instead of g_malloc.
	Helps get rid of silly "sizeof (char)" business.
	Remove athena_str_escape_slashes.

	Adding a portion of the shared download / parse framework
	for summary configuration.

2000-08-30  Rebecca Schulman  <rebecka@eazel.com>
	Most of the work on 2369, to add the emblems to the search
	criteria.  This work involved refactoring the code to generate
	property information for display.  This new code is used by the
	code to create the search criterion, and also by the emblem
	display code, which is in athena-property-browser.
	

	* libathena-extensions/Makefile.am:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-customization-data.c:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-customization-data.h:

	(get_file_path_for_mode),
	(athena_customization_make_background_chit),
	(format_name_for_display), (strip_extension):
	New file with extracted methods from athena-property browser.
	The new API initiates a new structure, and has an iterative call
	to "get the next element for display" which returns a correctly
	sized pixmap widget and a label widget containing the name appropriate
	for display.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-dateedit-extensions.c:
	(athena_gnome_date_edit_get_date_as_string):
	Removed extraneous debugging printf.

	(make_emblem_value_menu):
	Added code to generate the emblem menu, and to generate a 
	search criterion for the search uri from the menu's settings.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-search-uri.c:
	More language updated, and added text for emblems
	
	* src/athena-property-browser.c: (make_drag_image),

	Make restart save window sizes, positions, and uri's in a gconf
	setting, so that the windows can be (mostly) restored.

	"throbber spam".

	* libathena-extensions/athena-mime-actions.c:
	(athena_mime_get_default_component_for_uri_internal):
	Fixed bug 1158, GnomeVFSMimeHandlers code needs error handling.

	There was a lonely FIXME here.  A NULL is now returned instead of
	an assert. A NULL is handled properly by all callers of this function.

	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c: (event_callback),

	Work in progress trying to get keyboard events to the desktop.
	I am working with John Harper on this.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-druid.[ch],

	  po/POTFILES.in:
	  Make AthenaDruid be a derivation of GnomeDruid and
	  the AthenaDruidPageEazel of GnomeDruidPage.  Also make
	  use of more of the athena style of coding in both.  Federico

	Fixed bug that showed up as warnings on exit and fails of "make

	calling "call_when_ready" callbacks. I improved the structure here
	a bit too by making a new function.

2000-08-29  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2223 (selecting separator of "View As" option
	menu causes problems).

	Surprise, surprise, surprise -- separator menu items are
	not treated as insensitive by default, so you can select
	them. This makes no difference in pull-down menus, but
	leads to trouble in option menus.

	* src/athena-window.c:

	a athena_navigation_bar_set_location call with a comment
	explaining why not to call it there.

2000-08-29  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2173 (We should allow clearing the History list)
	There's now a Forget History item in the Go menu which
	(after confirmation) forgets the history items in the Go
	menu and the back/forward chains of each Athena window.
	Afterwards, the Go menu's history list contains only locations
	currently being displayed.

	* src/athena-window.h: Changed back_list and forward_list
	from GSList * to GList * so I could use athena glist 
	convenience functions (there's no efficiency issue with these 
	small lists). Added prototypes for new functions
	athena_clear_back_list, athena_clear_forward_list, and
	athena_forget_history.
	
	* src/athena-window.c: 
	(athena_window_clear_forward_list),
	(athena_window_clear_back_list): New functions that free and
	set to NULL the back & forward lists.
	(athena_window_destroy): Use athena_window_clear_back_list
	and athena_window_clear_forward_list instead of replicating code.
	(athena_window_back_or_forward),
	(athena_window_get_base_page_index): Replace "slist" with "list"
	(free_history_list): Set history_list variable to NULL in addition
	to freeing its contents.
	(athena_forget_history): New function, walks through all windows
	clearing out their back/forward lists, and throws away all of the
	history list except currently-displayed locations.

	* src/athena-window-manage-views.c: (handle_go_back),
	(handle_go_forward), (handle_go_elsewhere): Changed "slist"
	to "list" in various places; called new athena_clear_forward_list
	instead of replicating code.
	
	* src/athena-window-menus.c: 
	(forget_history_if_confirmed): New function, calls athena_history_forget
	if user confirms via modeless dialog (because it would be a pain to
	accidentally choose this menu item and erase your history).
	(go_menu_forget_history_callback): New function used by new menu item,
	calls forget_history_if_confirmed.
	(athena_window_initialize_menus): Add "Forget History" item to Go menu.
	
	* src/athena-window-toolbars.c: (create_back_or_forward_menu):
	Replace "slist" with "list"

        Entity support done in the bad evil way! (fixes bug #2200)
        (we should re-write gnome-db2html2 to use the DOM parser - but this

	per directory in the metadata.

	Fixed bug 1782 (File->Open after opening a folder crashes)
	The problem was that the menus weren't being updated when

	Added menus_merged boolean to Details struct.
	(fm_directory_view_merge_menus): Set menus_merged to TRUE.
	(fm_directory_view_load_uri): update menus when loading URI,
	but only if menus_merged is TRUE (so you don't try to update
	nonexistent menus the first time, which would make Bonobo sad)

2000-08-25  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1934 ("View as" menu gets ludicrously tall when
	you add search criteria)

	* src/athena-window.c: (athena_window_constructed):
	Put "View as" option menu into a GtkVBox so it doesn't
	insist on filling the available space vertically.

	  cut-n-paste-code/widgets/athena-druid/athena-druid.c
	  (athena_druid_size_request):
	  Fix height issue in size_request and set the druid page height back
	  to the correct size (322 pixels)

	* src/athena-first-time-druid.c (user_level_selection_changed),
	  (make_label_bold) (make_hbox_user_level_radio_button)
	  (set_up_user_level_page):  Partial arloyfication of the
	  user level page.  Not yet using AthenaLabel because
	  that appears to be broken (or I'm using it wrong, will
	  investigate).

2000-08-25  Michael Engber  <engber@eazel.com>

	Refactored draw_pixbuf_aa.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-background.c: (draw_pixbuf_aa),

	(is_floppy_mount_path): Added helper.
	(floppy_sort): Simplified logic.
	(athena_volume_monitor_get_removable_volume_names): Used the
	prepend/reverse idiom instead of append.
	(athena_volume_monitor_volume_is_mounted): Fixed extremely
	unlikely but possible buffer overflow and checked result from
	sscanf.
	(mount_volume_mount): Use g_strchomp instead of rolling our own.
	Took out some dead code.
	(mount_volumes_update_is_mounted): Fixed extremely unlikely but
	possible buffer overflow and checked result from sscanf.
	(mount_volume_add_aliases): Fixed possible buffer overflow and
	storage leak.
	(mount_volume_ext2_add): Removed code to ignore all ext2 volumes
	other than "/". Moved the hack into FMDesktopIconView.

	(free_volume_info), (get_iso9660_volume_name),
	(get_ext2_volume_name), (get_floppy_volume_name):
	Removed mount_type and volume_fd. Made a bunch of formerly-
	public things private and added ATHENA_ prefix to some public
	identifier that didn't have it.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-trash-directory.c:
	(get_volume_vfs_uri_if_writable):
	Changed callers to use the constants with the ATHENA_ prefix.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c: (create_mount_link):
	Moved the "/" hack here (marked with a FIXME and bug number) and
	made the two cases that create mount links share code. Also
	made it use type instead of the now-gone mount_type.
	(startup_create_mount_links), (volume_mounted_callback): Call the
	new common routine instead of having two copies of the same code.

2000-08-25  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Made sorting by size put big ones first, to match
	common sense. (Date now puts recent ones first by
	the same reasoning.) Changed "Ascending/Descending"
	pair of items to single "Reversed Order" item so
	it isn't making any promises about order.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(athena_file_compare_directories_by_size): Reverse
	the logic for directory ordering.
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: 
	Changed Details field from updating_bonobo_radio_menu_item
	to updating_bonobo_marked_menu_item since it now covers one
	toggle item also.
	(update_layout_menus), (sort_callback), (sort_direction_callback),
	(manual_layout_callback), (fm_icon_view_merge_menus): Changed
	all the code dealing with "Ascending/Descending" radio-item pair
	to deal with single "Reversed Order" toggle item instead.

	(athena_image_initialize_class), (athena_image_draw),
	(athena_image_expose_event), (athena_image_paint),
	(athena_image_set_alpha_mode):
	Add support for two alpha rendering modes: 1) FULL, the pixbuf is
	composited on top of the widget's background - expensive.  2)
	THRESHOLD, the pixbuf is drawn with an alpha threshold without any
	compositing - fast but not as smooth.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-label.c: (render_buffer_pixbuf):
	Remove a dumb printf i left in before.

	(smooth_graphics_mode_changed_callback):
	Use the new dual alpha support in the image class to simplify
	things.  Create only one icon and change the alpha mode on that
	when the smooth graphics preference changes.  Ill do the same for
	emblems later.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-buffered-widget.h:

	Add suport for a vertical and horizontal offset.  Pass these on to

	with them.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-image.c:
	(athena_image_initialize), (athena_image_size_request),

	* libathena-extensions/athena-image.h:

	Use the GtkMisc xpad/ypad into account when computing the

	Add preliminary support an alpha mode so that the image widget can
	server as a regular thresholded pixbuf display without doing the
	full and expensive compositing on the background.  Not hooked up yet.

	Update for vertical/horizontal offset support.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-label.c:

	* components/tree/athena-tree-view.oafinfo.exe: Added
	* components/tree/athena-tree-view.oafinfo.shlib: Added
	* configure.in:

	Added capability to build the tree view as either a shared library
	server or an executable server, as part of the plan to fix
	1647. However, using the shlib component causes massive
	instability in both the tree view and athena in general. I am
	leaving the executable component the default until I fix this.

	  (athena_druid_init), (athena_druid_size_request),

	* icons/Makefile.am, icons/druid_*.png: Add Arlo's druid images.

	* po/POTFILES.in,
	  cut-n-paste-code/widgets/athena-druid/athena-druid-page-eazel.c,
	  cut-n-paste-code/widgets/athena-druid/athena-druid-page-eazel.h:
	  Add the eazel druid page.  Theoretically this should move to
	  libathena-extentions soon, including deriving athena-druid from
	  gnome-druid, in which way we can eliminate the entire
	  cut-n-paste mess for the druid.  Likely to do this tommorrow with

2000-08-25  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* components/services/install/command-line/Makefile.am:
	No longer builds anything else then eazel-install.
	* components/services/install/command-line/eazel-alt-install-corba.c:
	(install_failed), 
	Changed output...
	(create_package), 
	if used with --file and the filename does not start with /, adds
	$cwd to filename
	(main):
	Commandline arg for rpm db root
	
	* components/services/install/idl/trilobite-eazel-install.idl:
	Added the rpm db root arg to install, uninstall, query and revert.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-corba-callback.h:
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-corba-callback.c:
	(eazel_install_callback_install_packages),
	(eazel_install_callback_uninstall_packages),
	(eazel_install_callback_simple_query),
	(eazel_install_callback_revert_transaction):
	Added support for rpm db root arguments for the four major

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-corba.c:
	(impl_Eazel_Install_install_packages),
	(impl_Eazel_Install_uninstall_packages),
	(impl_Eazel_Install_revert_transaction),
	(impl_Eazel_Install_simple_query):
	Decode the root arg... big stuff heh ?
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-public.h:

	(eazel_install_revert_transaction_from_file),
	(eazel_install_query_package_system), (string_list_copy),
	(eazel_install_set_root_dirs):
	Changed the root_dir GtkArg to a GList, so you can set the array
	of roots to use. The object defaults to use /var/lib/rpm and
	~/.athena/rpmdb as roots. If ~/.athena/rpmdb does not exist,
	it will create a rpmdb in this dir.
	In -private.h, I've removed the rpmdb var in the packsys.rpm
	union, and now have a hashtable that maps from root dir to rpmdb.
	in the private struct, there is also a cur_root var, which holds
	the root given to the four calls, or DEFAULT_RPM_DB_ROO
	(/var/lib/rpm) if called with root==NULL.

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-protocols.c:
	(gnome_vfs_xfer_callback), (gnome_vfs_fetch_remote_file):
	Added gnome_vfs_callback_struct so I can transfer both the
	file_to_report and EazelInstall object. Thus gnome-vfs downloads
	now again reports short names (eg. xfig instead of
	xfig-3.2.2-_beta1-2).
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-query.h:
	Comments on how to use the query call.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-query.c:
	(eazel_install_simple_rpm_query), 
	Now collects the result into a parameter instead of returning a glist.
	(eazel_install_simple_query):
	If no cur_root is set in the EazelInstall object, it queries on
	all the databases, otherwise, it only queries the cur_root db.
	Plus I fixed some horribleness in the vaarg stuff.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-rpm-glue.c:

	(eazel_install_ensure_deps), 
	Changed to use the new hashtable of rpmdb's.
	
	(eazel_uninstall_upward_traverse),
	(eazel_uninstall_downward_traverse),
	(eazel_uninstall_check_for_install), 
	(eazel_uninstall_globber):
	The uninstall stuff uses eazel_install_simple_query now (bug
	1697). Also did more work on the downward traverse, although I
	still feel it's too dangerous to actually use. But now the upwards
	works properly (by using the neglist feature in the query, fixes
	bug 1539)
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-types.c:
	(packagedata_fill_from_rpm_header):
	Eek, I used pointers into the rpmheader instead of copying them
	out. At least that 
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-xml-package-list.c:
	(xml_get_prop), 
	Made a funky xml_get_prop call, that like xmlGetProp gets a
	property, but also g_strdup's it and free the malloc'ed libxml value.
	(parse_category), (generate_xml_package_list),
	(osd_parse_implementation), (osd_parse_softpkg),
	(parse_osd_xml_from_memory):
	Uses xml_get_prop
	 
	* components/services/install/athena-view/athena-service-install.
	c: (athena_service_install_view_install_package_callback),
	(athena_service_install_view_uninstall_package_callback):
	Pass NULL for the root parameter, that causes eazelinstall to

	More cleanup of the RPM install view: rudimentary password dialog,
	cleaned out old unused code, and hooked up the RPM package info to
	display in the top field, instead of the fake "The Gimp" info.
	Also removed the forced delays in updating (install happens in

	Added a Change Desktop Background item to the right click

	* configure.in: Added "ga" to ALL_LINGUAS

2000-08-24  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1653 (new menu layout). View menu now contains
	Show/Hide items for tool bar, location bar, sidebar, and
	status bar. The preference now controls only what you get
	for new windows. Any future "menus aren't quite right" 
	issues should be filed as new bugs.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.c:
	(global_preferences_create_dialog), (global_preferences_register):
	Renamed ATHENA_PREFERENCES_DISPLAY_SIDEBAR and its ilk to
	ATHENA_PREFERENCES_START_WITH_SIDEBAR since these preferences
	now only affect the initial appearance of new windows. Also,
	clarified the text that appears in the preferences window for these.
	
	* src/athena-window-menus.c:
	Removed a bunch of code #ifdeffed WINDOW_ITEMS_TEST since the
	functionality it partly implemented is now implemented for real.
	(view_menu_show_hide_sidebar_callback),
	(view_menu_show_hide_tool_bar_callback),
	(view_menu_show_hide_location_bar_callback),
	(view_menu_show_hide_status_bar_callback):
	New menu callback functions that toggle the visibility of the
	various views.
	(athena_window_update_show_hide_menu_items): New function,
	sets the text in the show/hide menu items based on current
	visibility.
	(athena_window_initialize_menus): Put the Show/Hide menu items
	in the menu.
	* src/athena-window-private.h: Add prototype for
	athena_window_update_show_hide_menu_items.
	* src/athena-window.h: Renamed statusbar_ctx -> status_bar_context_id
	and statusbar_clear_id -> status_bar_clear_id; renamed show/hide
	locationbar/toolbar/statusbar to use location_bar, tool_bar, and
	status_bar (GTK bad English usage notwithstanding); added prototypes
	for athena_window_sidebar_showing and its ilk.
	* src/athena-window.c: 
	(athena_window_initialize), (athena_window_destroy): Removed
	monitoring & unmonitoring of DISPLAY_SIDEBAR-type preferences since
	changing these preferences now has no dynamic effect.
	(athena_window_clear_status), (athena_window_set_status),
	(athena_window_constructed): Fixed wordgroupingification of 
	status_bar et al.
	(show_dock_item), (hide_dock_item): New functions to share code of
	show/hide location bar & tool bar functions; these call
	athena_window_update_show_hide_menu_items now also.
	(dock_item_showing): New function, tests visibility of named dock item.
	(athena_window_hide_location_bar),
	(athena_window_show_location_bar),
	(athena_window_hide_tool_bar), (athena_window_show_tool_bar):
	Use new code-sharing functions.
	(athena_window_location_bar_showing),
	(athena_window_tool_bar_showing), 
	(athena_window_sidebar_showing),
	(athena_window_status_bar_showing): New functions to test visibility
	(athena_window_hide_sidebar),
	(athena_window_show_sidebar), 
	(athena_window_hide_status_bar),
	(athena_window_show_status_bar): These call 
	athena_window_update_show_hide_menu_items now.
	(athena_window_show): Updated for naming changes.

	* RENAMING: Noted that the evil one-word "toolbar" phrase
	is still rampant in Athena.

2000-08-24  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2119 (Alt-key navigation for menus doesn't work).

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(key_press_event):
	* libathena-extensions/athena-list.c:
	(athena_list_key_press):
	Made the type-select mechanism for list and icon views not
	eat alt-key combinations, so they can be used for pulling
	down menus.

2000-08-23  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	status on downloading and installing various RPMs.
	 
2000-08-23  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	More work on bug 1653 (new menu layout). Now there's a
	permanent "View" menu that contains Refresh and zooming
	items and the icon view merges its stuff in there. The
	icon view now has a "Clean Up by Name" item to do a
	one-shot sort of icons in manual layout mode.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(key_press_event): 
	* libathena-extensions/athena-list.c:
	(athena_list_key_press):

	to zoom on the desktop.
		
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.h:
	Define clean_up function pointer
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: 
	(set_sort_criterion): Just moved this function.
	(fm_icon_view_clean_up): New function, calls virtual function.
	(fm_icon_view_real_clean_up): New function, sorts one time by name.

	(update_layout_menus): Update sensitivity of Clean Up item
	(get_next_position): New helper function to get a position for
	a Bonobo menu item based on the one you want to be after. Works

	(athena_window_zoom_to_fit): Renamed these to better match new
	shared-between-files status, and reordered the parameters.
	(athena_window_constructed): use gtk_signal_connect_object with
	athena_window_zoom functions since their parameters have flipped.
	(athena_window_zoom_level_changed_callback): Set sensitivity of
	zooming menu items appropriately.
	* src/athena-window-manage-views.c:

	a good idea.  I am backing it out for now.

2000-08-23  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2282, Undo menu item initially sensitive, but 
	nothing to undo.
	
	* components/notes/athena-notes.c: (finish_loading_note),

	(athena_read_entire_file): Added missing close calls.
	(read_file_close_callback): Got rid of overzealous check for

	care much since we've already read the file contents.

2000-08-23  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-async.c:
	(get_info_callback): Added missing call to athena_file_changed
	for the case where get_file_info fails.
	(start_getting_file_info): Fixed broken logic that was recursing
	instead of looping when get_file_info fails and added missing call
	to athena_file_changed.
	(athena_directory_async_state_changed): Moved the check for
	ready callbacks to the end of the function. This fixed the problem
	with the trash properties never showing up.

2000-08-21  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-merged-directory.c:

	real directories into a separate base class. Also finished the
	implementation, leaving only unimportant loose ends.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-trash-directory.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-trash-directory.c:
	(get_volume_vfs_uri_if_writable), (find_directory_callback),

	hash table iterator that works even if the callback removes items
	from the hash table.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-scalable-font.c:
	(athena_scalable_font_largest_fitting_font_size): Added code to
	handle the case of an empty name; the old code worked with NULL,
	but not with "".

	* src/athena-window-manage-views.c: (compute_default_title),
	(athena_window_update_title): Made two changes to the default
	title: 1) Use "" instead of "Athena" when there's no title.
	We still use "Athena" in the window title, but not in the
	sidebar any more. 2) Use the scheme part of a URI if there's
	nothing after the colon. This works nicely for the trash.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-background-canvas-group.c:
	(athena_background_canvas_group_render): Removed some unneeded
	code and the FIXME that goes with it.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory.c:

	* libathena-extensions/athena-label.h:

	Add support for drop shadows.

	* src/athena-sidebar-title.c:
	(athena_sidebar_title_initialize):

	Make the offset between labels more pleasing to comrade arlo.

2000-08-21  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Finished bug 1750 ("Reveal in New Window" feature for 
	search results). Now choosing this menu item opens the
	right window, selects the right item, and scrolls as
	necessary to reveal the selected item.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.h,
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(athena_icon_container_reveal): New function, wrapper for
	existing private reveal_icon function that first finds the
	AthenaIcon for the given AthenaIconData.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-list.h,
	* libathena-extensions/athena-list.c:
	(athena_list_reveal_row): Renamed this function from
	reveal_row and made it public.
	(keyboard_row_reveal_timeout_callback): Accounted for
	name change
	(athena_list_get_first_selected_row): New function, returns
	index of first selected item.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (fm_icon_view_set_selection),
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: (fm_list_view_set_selection):
	reveal first selected item. This has the (good, I think) side effect
	of scrolling as necessary to make sure at least one selected item
	is in view whenever the selection is explicitly set, which includes
	when creating a new folder and when switching views with an existing
	selection (but beware, switching from list view to icon view with a
	selection currently crashes due to bug 2222).

2000-08-21  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2137, renaming of trash causes a duplicate trash to 
	appear.
	If the user renames trash, it will get renamed back to Trash
	when the desktop is restarted.  When we have individual file reneaming
	permissions, this will never be an issue.

	Fixed bug 2144, renaming home link on desktop causes a duplicate 
	to appear.
	 
	* libathena-extensions/athena-link.c:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-link.h:
	(athena_link_is_home_link), (athena_link_is_trash_link):
	Two new functions to identify specific types of links
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_initialize):
	Trash link is now created here,

	(find_home_link),
	(place_home_directory):
	Modified functions to handle situations where home link 
	has been renamed by the user.

	(find_and_rename_trash_link),
	(create_or_rename_trash):
	New functions to handle creation of trash link.
	
	* src/athena-desktop-window.c: 
	(athena_desktop_window_new):
	Moved creation of trash link to FMDesktopIconView

2000-08-21  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-factory.c:
	(athena_get_current_icon_factory), (icon_theme_changed_callback):
	made the icon factory ask the current theme for the icon directory
	to use, so themes can easily use each other's icons without copying
	them.
	
2000-08-21  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-buffered-widget.c:
	(athena_buffered_widget_realize):
	Add a evil hack to keep track of background changes.  I have a
	better fix for this that I will commit soon.

	(anti_aliased_mode_changed_callback):
	* src/athena-sidebar-title.h:
	* src/athena-sidebar.c: (background_appearance_changed_callback):

	Add support for smoother graphics.  Use new AthenaLabel and
	AthenaImage widgets to render alpha composited pixbufs and anti
	aliases text.

	The old non-smooth widgets are still supported and should continue
	to work as expected whenever the smooth graphics preference is
	toggled.

2000-08-21  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	After talking to Darin, split up 
	athena_file_get_parent_uri into a _for_display
	version and the standard "pure" one. We had callers
	that wanted each type.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.h,
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(athena_file_get_parent_uri_for_display):
	New function, formats the result of get_parent_uri
	for user-ready display.
	(athena_file_get_parent_uri): Took out the format
	code from this more basic function.
	(athena_file_compare_by_directory_name): Use the
	for_display version here.
	(athena_file_get_string_attribute): Use the

2000-08-21  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1456 ("file://" shouldn't appear in locations
	in Property window)

	Robert Brady <rwb197@zepler.org> submitted a patch for this
	bug (thanks Robert!). The patch worked, but I ended up fixing 
	it a somewhat different way when I realized that we had two 
	similar routines that needed to be merged.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(athena_file_get_directory_name): Removed this function;
	callers should use get_parent_uri instead.
	(athena_file_get_parent_uri): Use 
	athena_format_uri_for_display before returning result,
	since this call is intended for display purposes; beef up
	comment to explain.
	(athena_file_compare_by_directory_name): Use _get_parent_uri
	instaed of _get_directory_name
	(athena_file_get_string_attribute): Eliminate "directory"
	string attribute.
	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:
	(real_get_column_specification): Use "parent_uri" instead of
	"directory" name. The only visible effect this has is to remove
	the trailing slashes from the "Directory" column. Also, changed
	title of column from "Directory" to "Where" to match properties
	window.

	librsvg FreeType2 bases anti aliased text rendering.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-font-picker.c:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-font-picker.h:

	New font picker class.  I will soon use it in the preferences
	dialog instead of the current one.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-buffered-widget.c:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-buffered-widget.h:

	New virtual widget class that encapsulates the details of finding
	a suitable background for compositing pixbufs.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-image.c:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-image.h:

	Rewritten AthenaImage class.  Took out all the label stuff,
	which lives in its own class.  Now subclassed from
	AthenaBufferedWidget so that background the image gets
	composited on is always correct and groks AthenaBackground.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-label.c:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-label.h:

	New AthenaLabel widget class.  A label widget that is capable of
	displaying anti aliased text composited over a complex background.

	The background can be installed as AthenaBackground on a
	AthenaLabel widget or any of its ancestors.  The best background
	will automatically be found and used by the widget.

	* services/athena-dependant-shared/shared-service-widgets.h,
	* services/startup/athena-view/athena-service-startup-view.c:

	Update for changes in the AthenaImage api.  Unfortunately, these
	components are slightly broken now cause of the AthenaImage
	changes.  I will fix them shortly.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-string-map.c:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-string-map.h:

	New simple class to map an arbitrary number of strings to a single
	string.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-lib-self-check-functions.h:
	Add tests for the new string map class.
	
	* libathena-extensions/Makefile.am:

	Build the new widgets.  Also add some depedencies on the static
	libraries we link into this beast.  This way,
	libathena-extensions will rebuild of one if its dependency
	static libs is touched.

	(athena_widget_has_attached_background):
	* libathena-extensions/athena-background.h:

	New function to test whether a GtkWidget has an attatched
	AthenaBackground.  This is needed because of the
	athena_get_widget_background will implicitly attatch a
	background.  This creates serious problems for widget hierarchies
	where the only interesting background is that of an ancestor.

	* librsvg/rsvg.c (rsvg_ctx_free_helper) (rsvg_entity_decl):
	  use xml memory allocation/deallocation routines for strings
	  which are allocated/deallocated inside libxml to make glib
	  memory checking not crash

	* libathena-extentions/athena-gnome-extentions.[ch]:
	  add a function athena_gnome_stock_set_icon_or_register which
	  does the GnomeStock voodoo for setting stock toolbar icons to
	  arbitrary files

	* src/athena-window-toolbars.c (set_up_button):  Use the
	  athena_gnome_stock_set_icon_or_register function as per Darin's
	  FIXME which thus got removed.

	completes task 1567. it shows a bug in the way the history

	fixed soon.
	
	* components/history/athena-history-view.c:
	(history_load_location), (history_title_changed), (make_obj):
	add title_changed_callback, connect it to changed_title signal.
	make it call load_location.
	Hack evil stuff in load_location: a hand-made lock because the 
	function calls some gtk calls which seem to make the main loop 
	run at least once. This allowed the main loop to use the events 
	in the event queue and it happened that the title_changed signal
	is usually emited more than once so it called again the 
	non-reentrant signal callback... BAD THINGS HAPPENED.
	
	
	* libathena/athena-view-component.idl: add changed_title method 
	to Athena::View.
	* libathena/athena-view.c: (impl_Athena_View_title_changed),
	(athena_view_initialize_class): implement the new idl function and
	add a signal for it.
	* libathena/athena-view.h: add the new signal class method.

	
	* src/athena-view-frame-bonobo-control.c: add the title_changed 
	field to the vtable.
	* src/athena-view-frame-athena-view.c: (title_changed): idem.
	* src/athena-view-frame-private.h: idem.
	* src/athena-view-frame.c: (athena_view_frame_title_changed):
	add api function to emit the signal and make the actual corba call.
	* src/athena-view-frame.h: add function prototype.
	* src/athena-window-manage-views.c: add calls to 
	(athena_window_update_title): to notify view frames of changed 
	titles.

	More work on bug 1750 ("Reveal in New Window" feature for 
	search results). Now it opens a new window with the right
	item selected. The only remaining work is to make the new
	window scroll as necessary to reveal the item.

	Along the way, fixed an unreported bug where the selection
	wasn't being maintained on view switches.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-gtk-extensions.h:
	added #define for athena_gtk_marshal_NONE__STRING_POINTER.
	
	* libathena/athena-view-component.idl:
	Added open_in_new_window_and_select call.

	and into the view frame.

	* src/athena-window.h: added pending_selection field
	* src/athena-window-manage-views.h: added
	athena_window_open_in_new_window_and_select
	* src/athena-window.c: 
	(athena_window_open_in_new_window_and_select_callback),
	(athena_window_connect_view): Wiring to connect view
	frame signals to window.

	athena_view_frame_selection_changed. This was the source
	of the selection-not-preserved-across-view-changes bug.
	Darin came up with this fix.
	(open_location): Added a new_selection parameter to this
	bottleneck function. It is set as the pending_selection
	in the window.
	(athena_window_open_location),
	(athena_window_open_location_in_new_window),
	(athena_window_report_location_change): Update existing
	callers of open_location to pass NULL for new_selection parameter.
	(athena_window_open_in_new_window_and_select): New function,
	calls open_location with a selection (among other parameters).
	(athena_window_update_state): When loading a new location, set
	the location to pending_selection rather than NULL (and clear
	pending_selection later so it doesn't unnecessarily hang around).

	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:
	(reveal_selected_items_callback): 
	Call open_in_new_window_and_select instead of just 
	open_location_in_new_window

	Final cut at syncing our desktop background with GNOME's (bug 1047)
	Now we are notified when the background capplet makes a change
	to the desktop. There are still some problems, e.g. we don't get

	More menu tweaking, including switching over to use
	Bonobo "menu placeholders" for menu-merging components.

	Fixed bug 1859 (Need improved way to position added menu items)

	* libathena/athena-bonobo-ui.h:
	Removed all menu item paths except those we expect to
	be merged over (like "Select All"). Added new placeholder
	paths for components to use when merging instead of relying
	on the positions of specific menu items. Commented the intended
	use of each placeholder.

	to use placeholder paths or to base positions off other
	directory view menu items. Added separator before Empty Trash.
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.h: Updated #defines for
	directory view menu paths (some used by subclasses)
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (compute_menu_item_info):
	Change "Restore Icon to Unstretched Size" to "Restore Icon's
	Original Size" to match Arlo's wording (and similarly for
	the plural case)
	
	* src/athena-window-menus.c: 
	Moved in the menu paths that were moved out of athena-bonobo-ui.h
	(append_placeholder): New function, wrapper for 
	bonobo_ui_handler_menu_new_placeholder
	(athena_window_remove_bookmarks_menu_items),

	Simplified logic of rebuilding bookmarks menu by
	using placeholder instead of details->last_static_bookmark_path.
	(athena_window_initialize_menus): Insert the placeholders defined
	in athena-bonobo-ui.h; add Control-/ for "About Athena" per Arlo.
	(athena_window_remove_go_menu_items),

	* src/athena-window-private.h: Removed last_static_bookmark_path;
	moved #defines for back/forward/up menu paths here.
	* src/athena-window.c: (athena_window_destroy): Removed
	last_static_bookmark_path.

	Fixed bug 2166 (Clearing name field in Properties window doesn't work right)

	* src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c:
	(name_field_update_to_match_file): Changed a char * to const char *
	for clarity.
	(name_field_restore_original_name): New function, restores the original
	contents of the name field, no questions asked.
	(name_field_done_editing): When handling empty-string case, use
	restore_original_name instead of update_to_match_file, which was too
	clever for this case.

	slowly, but I need to check in at this point for Gene's sake.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-volume-monitor.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-volume-monitor.c:

	Create Link to bonobo menu.
	(fm_directory_view_real_update_menus): Update Create Link item
	when selection changes.
	(fm_directory_view_get_context_menu_index): Updated to match
	current set of items.
	
	* src/athena-window-menus.c: (athena_window_initialize_menus):
	Took Control-N away from "New Window" so "New Folder" could have it;
	gave "Close All Windows" Control-Shift-W

2000-08-17  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-dnd.c:
	(receive_dropped_keyword):
	implemented task 2078, we need a better drag and drop-based way to
	delete emblems, by adding an "erase emblems" emblem and special-casing
	it to erase the emblems.
	
	* data/emblems/Makefile.am:
	* data/emblems/erase.png:
	added Susan's erase emblem image
	
2000-08-17  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-image.c: (ensure_buffer_size),
	(athena_gdk_pixbuf_render_to_drawable):
	made it respect the alpha channel for ordinary images by making
	the buffer use an alpha channel and rending with an alpha channel if
	present.
	
	* src/athena-application.c: (need_to_show_first_time_druid):
	removed the code that set the first time flag here, since it
	shouldn't be set until the user has gone all the way through the
	druid.
	
	* src/athena-first-time-druid.c:

	* src/file-manager/athena-trash-monitor.c:
	(athena_trash_metadata_ready_callback):
	Remove extra parameters now that the initial files callback is
	gone. It turns out emitting another files_added signal works just
	fine. If it wasn't for the search list view, I could also merge
	the "file_added" and "files_changed" signals easily. Both of these
	changes would simplify the work on the virtual trash directory.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-link.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-link.c:
	Get rid of ATHENA_LINK constant, which looked like a link type,
	but was really an unrelated implementation detail.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c: (sort_icons),
	(resort), (lay_down_icons_tblr), (finish_adding_new_icons):
	Removed the file-manager-specific stuff Gene added for the desktop.
	I fight the continuing battle to keep AthenaIconContainer a
	general icon container, and not just for the Athena icon view.
	The drag code is still an exception to this that needs to be fixed
	some day (for AthenaList too).

	(athena_file_get_string_attribute):
	made athena_file_get_parent_uri public, and changed its name
	(was athena_file_get_parent_uri_as_string)
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.h:
	(contents_share_parent): New function pointer for subclasses 
	to optionally override. Subclasses should override to return
	FALSE if their contents might be from different directories.
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_initialize_class): Wire up 
	contents_share_parent function pointer
	(get_athena_file_from_directory): New helper function to
	get a AthenaFile from a AthenaDirectory
	(fm_directory_is_trash): Reimplemented to call existing
	function athena_file_is_in_trash and avoid duplicating code.
	(fm_directory_view_contents_share_parent): New function, calls
	the virtual function
	(real_contents_share_parent): New function, default implementation
	that returns TRUE since normal directory views' contents are all
	in the same parent directory.
	(all_files_in_trash): New function, checks if every file in a
	list is in the trash
	(fm_directory_all_selected_items_in_trash): New function, calls
	all_files_in_trash on selection or uses shortcut if
	fm_directory_view_contents_share_parent is true.
	(fm_directory_view_can_move_file_to_trash): Renamed from
	fm_directory_can_move_to_trash, and now takes a file parameter
	since the answer might vary on a file-by-file basis.
	(fm_directory_view_confirm_deletion): Spruced up wording, and
	now takes a list of uris instead of a list of files, and now
	separately handles the case where only some of the selected files
	had to be deleted immediately.
	(fm_directory_view_trash_or_delete_selection): Rewrote to handle
	three types of files separately: files that can be moved to the
	trash, files already in the trash, and files that have to be
	deleted in place.
	(compute_menu_item_info): Changed "Delete..." to "Delete from Trash".
	(fm_directory_view_real_create_selection_context_menu_items),
	(reset_bonobo_trash_delete_menu):
	use "Delete from Trash" only if all selected items in trash.
	(fm_directory_view_real_update_menus): Update "Delete from Trash"
	menu item also. Its sensitivity wasn't updating properly due to
	this missing line.
	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:
	(real_contents_share_parent): Overridden to return FALSE.
	(fm_search_list_view_initialize_class): wire up function pointer
	for contents_share_parent

2000-08-16  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(icon_toggle_selected), (icon_destroy),
	(athena_icon_container_remove):
	Fixed bug 2197, moving a file to trash while in renaming mode
	leaves renaiming item behind.
	Call end_renaming_mode in athena_icon_container_remove.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-dnd.c:
	(athena_icon_container_free_drag_data):
	Changed gtk_object_unref call to gtk_object_destroy to
	fix a crash.  Hopefully this didn't
	introduce a memory leak.
	
2000-08-16  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* README: Don't use tabs any more. Spell check.
	Add libglade.
	
	* components/tree/athena-tree-model.c:
	(athena_tree_model_monitor_add),
	(athena_tree_model_monitor_node):
	Use file attribute constant instead of hard-coded string. I was
	here to make some changes to the monitor API, but I didn't get
	to that yet. Next check-in.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-async.c:
	(athena_directory_monitor_add_internal):
	Use "files_added" signal instead of callback. This is the first
	step toward removing the callback. I'll remove it tomorrow.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory.c:
	(athena_directory_notify_files_added): Fix directory ref count
	leak.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(athena_file_get_internal): Fix case where we would not ref
	the AthenaFile even though the directory is monitoring it.
	This would lead to an early destroy later.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-search-uri.c:
	(athena_search_uri_to_human): Comment out print statements.
	Mathieu can delete them entirely later.
	(athena_self_check_search_uri): Added a few more tests.

	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-text-window.c:
	(create_attributes_option_menu):
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (fm_icon_view_merge_menus): Use
	_() instead of calling gettext. It turns out this is the
	recommended way to do it, even when the parameter is not a literal
	string.

2000-08-16  Michael Engber  <engber@eazel.com>

	Cleanup some of my desktop changes (better names) (bug 1047)
	Fix athena_background_get_image_placement, it was returning

2000-08-16  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* src/file-manager/dfos-xfer.c: (get_parent_make_name_list):
	The file-transfer mechanism can only handle files from the
	same parent directory right now. To prevent this from getting
	in the way of other work, I isolated the problem such that when
	you try to move/copy/make-link files from multiple directories,
	it puts up an alert warning you that it will ignore some of the
	files. Then it continues to process only the ones from the same
	directory as the first one it happened to examine.

2000-08-16  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-application.c: (athena_application_close_desktop):
	Changed gtk_object_unref call to gtk_object_destroy to
	fix an assertion being called.  Hopefully this didn't
	introduce a memory leak.

2000-08-15  Arlo Rose  <arlo@eazel.com>

	* AUTHORS:
	Added myself.
	This file is *seriously* out of date.

2000-08-15  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2172 (Need to support right-button-dragging in
	list view). This was a piece of list view dragging support
	that got overlooked before, but is necessary for search
	results.

	Some of this code is copy/paste/modified from 
	athena-icon-container.c and athena-icon-dnd.c. I added
	FIXMEs about this (there were some already).

	* libathena-extensions/athena-list.c:
	Added #defines for mouse buttons
	(show_context_menu_callback), (and get ready for a potential drag)
	(athena_list_button_release), (athena_list_unrealize),
	(athena_list_resize_column), (athena_list_drag_start),
	(athena_list_motion), (athena_list_drag_begin),
	(athena_list_drag_end), (athena_list_drag_leave),
	(athena_list_get_drop_action), (athena_list_drag_motion),
	(athena_list_drag_drop), (athena_list_drag_data_received):
	Changes are too intertwined to list function-by-function. The
	main ones are: replaced uses of mouse button constants with
	#defines; Made middle button do nothing useful to match icon
	view (was mimicking left button); made right button either
	start a "choose the action on release" type drag or pop up
	the contextual menu after a timeout if no drag begins; took
	out some unnecessary asserts.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: (fm_list_handle_dropped_icons):
	Changed action >= 0 to action > 0 so it doesn't do a lot of
	useless work when user chooses Cancel after a right-click drag;
	moved g_free (list_view_uri) inside the block where list_view_uri
	is allocated.

2000-08-15  Michael Engber  <engber@eazel.com>

	Third cut at syncing our desktop background with GNOME's (bug 1047)
	Now we update the GNOME desktop (root window) when we make changes.
	Still need to handle athena getting notified when the capplet makes
	changes.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-background.c:
	(athena_background_initialize_class),

	(athena_self_check_search_uri): Fix the self-check, which was
	exposing some errors that need to be fixed. For now, the failing
	checks are commented out and marked with FIXME.

2000-08-15  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Getting closer to an implementation of the shared trash. Did a bit
	of factoring so that the trash has its own AthenaDirectory
	subclass now, and the appropriate functions are virtual.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory.c:
	(athena_directory_are_all_files_seen),
	(athena_directory_contains_file),
	(athena_directory_call_when_ready),
	(athena_directory_cancel_callback),
	(athena_directory_file_monitor_add),
	(athena_directory_file_monitor_remove),
	(athena_directory_is_not_empty): Made all these functions
	virtual.
	(wait_until_ready_callback),
	(athena_directory_wait_until_ready): Fixed some names and got
	rid of some type casts.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-gtk-macros.h: Added a new macro
	to make calls to virtual functions easier to read.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-private.h:
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_initialize):
	Minor cleanup and name changes.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-lib-self-check-functions.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-search-uri.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-search-uri.c:
	(athena_is_search_uri): Added a function to tell if a URI is a
	search URI.
	(athena_self_check_search_uri): Added self-checks.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-async.c:
	(allow_metafile):
	* src/athena-switchable-navigation-bar.c:
	(athena_switchable_navigation_bar_set_location):
	* src/athena-window-manage-views.c:
	(athena_window_end_location_change_callback):
	Changed to use the is_search_uri function.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-trash-directory.c:
	(trash_destroy), (trash_contains_file), (trash_call_when_ready),
	(trash_cancel_callback), (trash_file_monitor_add),
	(trash_file_monitor_remove), (trash_are_all_files_seen),
	(trash_is_not_empty), (athena_trash_directory_initialize_class):
	Trash versions of the virtual functions.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-vfs-directory.c: (vfs_destroy),
	(vfs_contains_file), (vfs_call_when_ready), (vfs_cancel_callback),
	(vfs_file_monitor_add), (vfs_file_monitor_remove),
	(vfs_are_all_files_seen), (any_non_metafile_item),
	(vfs_is_not_empty), (athena_vfs_directory_initialize_class):
	Non-trash versions of the virtual functions (mostly code moved
	from athena-directory.c).
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(disconnect_model_handlers): Fix a place that relied on doing a
	call with a AthenaDirectory of NULL. We don't need to be so
	tolerant of NULL any more now that athena_directory_get always
	returns a non-NULL result for any URI.
	
	* src/athena-window.c: (athena_window_realize):
	A little code cleanup.
	(athena_window_load_content_view_menu): Fixed a storage leak
	of the method string.

	* src/athena.oafinfo: Added trash and gnome-trash as additional
	URIs supported by the icon and list view.

2000-08-15  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed task 1414 (Emptying the trash needs a warning dialog)

	Implemented a simple confirmation dialog. Pavel said he and
	Arlo agreed to defer the feature of including information
	about the current trash contents in the dialog. I'll write up
	a new deferred bug for that.

	* src/file-manager/dfos-xfer.c: 
	(do_empty_trash): New function, does all the work of
	actually emptying the trash.
	(confirm_empty_trash): New function, puts up a modal dialog
	and returns whether user confirmed it. See comments in file
	as to why it's modal.
	(fs_empty_trash): Empties trash only if confirm_empty_trash
	returns TRUE.

2000-08-15  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(get_best_empty_grid_location), (lay_down_icons_tblr):
	Added horizontal and vertical padding for the tblr
	layout mode as per Arlo's spec.

2000-08-15  Raph Levien  <raph@acm.org>

	* librsvg/art_render.c (art_render_image_solid_negotiate): Only
	sets ART_IMAGE_SOURCE_CAN_COMPOSITE when a compositing callback is
	selected. Previously was causing segfaults on non-alpha
	images. Thanks to Leonard Rosenthol for spotting the bug.

2000-08-15  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	Implements core of task 1761 
	
	* libathena-extensions/Makefile.am: add my new files 
	to the build.
	* libathena-extensions/athena-search-uri.c:
	(strip_uri_begenning), (free_tokenized_uri), (tokenize_uri),
	(get_item_number), (get_translated_criterion),
	(get_first_criterion_prefix), (get_nth_criterion_prefix),
	(get_nth_criterion_suffix), (get_first_criterion_suffix),
	(parse_uri), (athena_search_uri_to_human): add file.
	* libathena-extensions/athena-search-uri.h: add file.
	* po/POTFILES.in: add my files there.
	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c: (load_location_callback):
	a space.
	* src/athena-complex-search-bar.c:
	(athena_complex_search_bar_initialize),
	(attach_criterion_to_search_bar),
	(unattach_criterion_from_search_bar):
	fix multiple bugs: the size text entry would not be removed by 
	the "fewer options" button. Changed a few "pressed" to "clicked".

2000-08-14  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(icon_set_position), (get_best_empty_grid_location):
	Fixed bug in postioning icons on the left edge of 
	the desktop.  Some fine tuning of initial default icon
	placement.
	
2000-08-15  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* components/services/install/command-line/Makefile.am:
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-metadata.c:
	(create_default_configuration_metafile),
	(init_default_install_configuration),
	(init_default_transfer_configuration), (transferoptions_destroy):
	Changed some of the default values.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-object.c:
	(eazel_install_unref), (eazel_install_set_arg),
	(eazel_install_class_initialize),
	(eazel_install_fetch_remote_package_list),
	(eazel_install_install_packages),
	(eazel_install_uninstall_packages):
	Removed rpm_storage_path, as we query the server for a complete
	url. Unref calls finalize if compiled with EAZEL_INSTALL_SLIM.
	fetch_remote_package_list now uses file:// unless _SLIM is defined
	(file:// makes gnome-vfs download the bastard).
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-private.h:
	Made the subcommand_cammand boolean volatile.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-protocols.h:
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-protocols.c:
	(http_fetch_remote_file), (ftp_fetch_remote_file),
	(gnome_vfs_xfer_callback), (gnome_vfs_fetch_remote_file),
	(local_fetch_remote_file), (eazel_install_fill_file_fetch_table),
	(eazel_install_fetch_file), (filename_from_url),
	(eazel_install_fetch_package),
	(eazel_install_fetch_package_which_provides), (add_to_url),
	(get_url_for_package), (get_search_url_for_package):
	Added gnome-vfs support (1301). Revamped a lot of the switch
	(protocol) calls, so now theres a table of function pointers, so
	eazel_install_fetch_file just uses
	func_table[protocol](...). Thereby making it easier to add
	protocols.
	Also more #ifdefs to make life easier on the poor
	athena-installer.
	And I added file_to_report to eazel_install_fetch_file, so it can
	use an alternative filename in the download progress signals,
	instead of the target filename (eg. Eye of Gnome instead of
	eog-x.y.z-bla1.i386.rpm).
	Added g_main_iteration calls to http_fetch, for the
	athena-installer. The gnome-vfs automagically calls it.
	local_file_fetch now emits the obiligatory signals.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-public.h:

	* src/file-manager/athena-trash-monitor.c:
	(add_one_writable_device), (get_trashable_volume_uris),
	(athena_trash_monitor_async_get_trash_directories):
	* src/file-manager/athena-trash-monitor.h:
	Fix bugzilla 1855 - athena_trash_monitor_async_get_trash_directories
	returns the list of URIs of all the available trash directories, finding
	and creating them as needed.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-volume-monitor.c: (floppy_sort),
	(mount_device_check_change), (mount_devices_update_is_mounted),

	* libathena-extensions/athena-volume-monitor.h:
	Made athena_volume_monitor_find_mount_device call
	mount_devices_check_status explicitly so that the mounted volume state
	is correct when the call returns.
	Add athena_volume_monitor_each_device and
	athena_volume_monitor_each_mounted_device.
	Moved AthenaVolumeMonitorDetails into athena-volume-monitor.c,
	away from prying eyes.
	Tweak some string matching code.

2000-08-14  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2159 (crash when trying to drag a selected item
	in list view). This was getting in the way of me trying to
	figure out what does & doesn't work in the search results
	view.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-list.c:
	Got rid of details->clicked_row, since there was already a 
	details->button_down_row with the same intended use. 
	Also changed dnd_select_pending from int to gboolean to match 
	its use.
	(athena_list_button_press): Set details->button_down_row to
	-1 before handling click; remove line sometimes but not always
	updating clicked_row (that was the source of the bug)
	(athena_list_button_release): Remove line setting
	clicked_row back to -1 after release; this was unnecessary.
	(athena_list_drag_start): Use button_down_row instead of
	clicked_row

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(desktop_icons_sort), (lay_down_icons_tblr), (lay_down_icons):
	Fixed some sorting bugs when dealing with inital icon layout
	in tblr mode.
	
2000-08-14  Michael Engber  <engber@eazel.com>

	Second cut at syncing our desktop background with GNOME's (bug 1047)
	Now we support images being centered and scaled (not just tiled)
	Although, there is no UI in athena to set this up (use the background
	capplet) Still need to handle update issues.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-background.c:

	athena_gdk_pixbuf_scale_to_fit was renamed to
	athena_gdk_pixbuf_scale_down_to_fit and also changed
	to not unref it's argument pixbuf. This involved fixing
	up various places it was used.

2000-08-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Some bug fixes, including a fix for bug 2156 (all sidebar panels
	fail on view switch).

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-async.c:
	(dequeue_pending_idle_callback), (directory_load_done): Make sure
	files are actually on the file list before emitting the
	files_added signal.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(athena_file_get_internal): Fixed a mistake on my last check-in
	relating to NULL directories.
	
	* src/athena-window-private.h:
	* src/athena-window-manage-views.c:
	(athena_window_has_really_changed): Fixed code so that it removes
	old sidebar panels in a way that won't seem like an error to the
	error-detecting code.
	(athena_window_set_state_info): Keep the same sidebar panels when
	we change the view and not the location. Also took out two unused
	"states".
	(athena_window_begin_location_change): Got rid of "SYNC_STATE".
	
	* src/athena-window.c: A bit of reformatting.

2000-08-14  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(lay_down_icons_tblr):
	Made sure that an icon is added to the layout grid when it is
	postioned during a multi-icon placement.
	Freeze the icon positions after we are done placing them using
	this layout mode.

2000-08-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	(athena_vfs_directory_initialize_class),
	(athena_vfs_directory_initialize),
	(athena_vfs_directory_destroy):
	* libathena-extensions/athena-vfs-directory.h:
	Add subclasses for the trash and for general VFS directories.
	Using refactoring techniques to move code down into these
	subclasses. This is not intended to be a general framework,
	but should be good enough to handle both these cases.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-async.c:

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.h:
	Add code to handle case of directory that can't be handled by
	gnome-vfs. Mostly some NULL checks. Also renamed fields to make
	it clear that the text URI is the "real" one. Added code to
	handle the "gnome-trash:" and "trash:" schemes specially in the
	code to make URIs canonical.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-mime-actions.c:
	(get_mime_type_from_uri): Return "application/octet-stream"
	instead of NULL for unknown MIME type.

	Fixed formatting mistake.
	
	* src/athena-view-frame.c: (set_up_for_new_location): Emit

2000-08-14  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.h:
	(desktop_icons_sort), (find_open_grid_space),
	(get_best_empty_grid_location), (mark_icon_location_in_grid),
	(mark_icon_locations_in_grid), (lay_down_icons_tblr),
	(lay_down_icons), (athena_icon_container_add):
	New functions for desktop layout mode.  We use a grid and
	decide where to place icons based on the first, best available
	free space on the desktop.	
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_initialize):
	Set our layout mode to be top-bottom-left-right

2000-08-14  Raph Levien  <raph@acm.org>

	* librsvg/test-ft-gtk.c: Substantial new code to fiddle
	with various options and measure performance.

	* librsvg/rsvg-ft.c: A warning printed when the glyph is not
	loaded. However, it looks at this point like there's a
	nasty bug triggered when the glyph fails to load (see bug 2140).

2000-08-14  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c:
	(forget_properties_window): Swapped the order of
	athena_file_monitor_remove and athena_file_unref.
	Unref must happen after we're otherwise done with the
	file (I hadn't seen any symptoms of this bug).
	(get_and_ref_file_to_display): Add ATHENA_LINK_TRASH
	to the set of athena-link types for which we show the
	target's properties. Currently that means you get the
	properties of the single Trash directory.

2000-08-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: Fixed GtkHTML configure section so it will
	work with 3-part version numbers. I didn't really know the
	"good" way to do this, so I just fixed the sed command to
	work with multi-part versions and didn't try to fix any
	other aspect of this. This change was required to make the
	configure work with GtkHTML 0.6.1.

2000-08-14  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Finished the remaining details of bug 2061 (Show Properties 
	should show volume properties for desktop icons). I split 
	the "Show Properties for Trash" bug off as a separate task 
	(2146), since it has its own set of issues.

	* src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.h:
	Eliminated fm_properties_window_get_or_create, which
	returned a GtkWindow, in favor of new
	fm_properties_window_present, which doesn't. This was
	required to do create the window asynchronously.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(open_one_properties_window): Switch caller to use new
	fm_properties_window_present. It had been wiring up an
	Undo manager on the result window; this code got moved
	into the asynchronous callback part of creating a
	properties window.

	* src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c:
	(create_pixmap_widget_for_file): ref file stored with pixmap
	widget; this had been creating a ref/unref mismatch that we
	had never noticed before probably due to extraneous refs elsewhere.
	(name_field_focus_out),	(name_field_focus_in), (create_basic_page): 
	Only do special	focus handling with the name field if it's sensitive.

	(create_properties_window_callback): New function, asynchronous
	callback to create the properties window.
	(get_and_ref_file_to_display): initialize file_to_display to NULL.
	This was crashing non-special-Desktop-case Properties windows.
	(fm_properties_window_present): Create properties window using
	asynchronous athena_file_call_when_ready, so we don't try to
	create the window until we know whether the file is a directory.
	This had never caused problems before because we had only tried
	to show properties for existing, info-bearing AthenaFile objects.

2000-08-14  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-shell.c: (display_caveat): Wrapped the
	image in the caveat dialog in a GtkVBox such that the
	frame & image will remain unstretched at the top of the
	dialog if the text gets taller than the image. We might
	want to take this (trivial & safe) change for the
	preview release if we end up making the caveat text longer.

2000-08-13  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	added a separate theme selection window and removed theme selection from the
	property browser
	
	* src/Makefile.am:
	* src/athena-theme-selector.h:
	added athena theme selector class		
	
	* src/athena-theme-selector.c:
	(athena_theme_selector_initialize_class),
	(athena_theme_selector_initialize),
	(athena_theme_selector_destroy), (athena_theme_selector_new),

	(athena_theme_selector_highlight_by_name),
	(athena_theme_selector_theme_changed),

	(make_theme_description), (set_preferred_font_for_cell),
	(add_theme), (populate_list_with_themes):
	added a class that presents a window that describes the existing themes and
	allows the user to switch between them.
	
	* src/athena-window-menus.c: (change_appearance_callback),
	(athena_window_initialize_menus):
	added a menu item to invoke the theme selector
	
	* src/athena-property-browser.c:
	(athena_property_browser_initialize), (make_category):
	removed support for themes from the property browser
	* data/browser.xml:
	removed the themes browser category
	
	* icons/Makefile.am:
	removed the themes.png icon
	* icons/arlo/arlo.xml:
	* icons/default.xml:
	* icons/vector/vector.xml:
	added descriptions for display in the theme selection

	* src/athena-sidebar-tabs.c:
	(athena_sidebar_tabs_initialize_class),
	(athena_sidebar_tabs_size_allocate):
	removed unnecessary override of size_request
	
2000-08-12  Raph Levien  <raph@acm.org>

	* librsvg/rsvg-ft.c: Got glyph cache working. Eviction when
	cache is full is not yet done, though, so RAM usage can grow.

	This checkin caused an API change! The xpen and ypen fields
	of the RsvgFTGlyph structure are now relative to the tranlation
	components of the affine (ie affine[4] and affine[5]). Prior
	to this checkin, they were relative to the upper left corner
	of the glyph.

	* librsvg/test-ft-gtk.c: Much tighter drawing, taking into
	account both bbox of what's to be drawn and the expose rect.

2000-08-12  Raph Levien  <raph@acm.org>

	* librsvg/makefile-simple (CFLAGS): Added suitable warnings
	so that broken code like the problem below doesn't slip through.

	* librsvg/test-ft-gtk.c (test_expose): Actually expose the
	entire window.

2000-08-12  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* librsvg/test-ft-gtk.c (set_text): Made this local function
	static to avoid warnings.

2000-08-12  Raph Levien  <raph@acm.org>

	* librsvg/test-ft-gtk.c: Added a simple Gtk+ test rig for rsvg-ft.
	I'll be instrumenting this for speed measurements, to play with
	the glyph cache.

	* Makefile.am: Added test-ft-gtk.

	* makefile-simple: A simple makefile for building rsvg without all
	the auto* overhead, for testing purposes.

2000-08-12  Ali Abdin  <aliabdin@aucegypt.edu>

        * components/help/help-method.c:
        (old_help_file): New function to return the old doc path.
        (transform_file): If we can not find the SGML or XML path use the old
        doc file (index.html)

2000-08-11  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-sidebar-tabs.c: (draw_or_layout_all_tabs):
	fixed "hole" in sidebar tabs in the arlo theme by using gdk_pixbuf_composite
	instead of gdk_pixbuf_copy_area for the edge pieces, so the alpha gets used instead
	of copied.
	
	* src/athena-sidebar.c: (athena_sidebar_motion_event):
	fixed bug where tabs were stay prelighted if you moved the mouse out quickly enough;
	fixed by setting the prelight state even when we're outside of the tabs
		
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-canvas-item.c: (map_pixbuf):
	fixed a problem drawing the audio preview icon now that I understand how
	composite works better

2000-08-11  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(icon_set_position), (lay_down_icons),
	(athena_icon_container_add):
	Added code to handle special desktop layout modes.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-volume-monitor.c:
	(athena_volume_monitor_destroy):
	Removed a double cleanup of a timewr callback.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_initialize):
	Set a default layout mode.  This is not the same
	as auto layout.

2000-08-11  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-application.c: (create_object): More renaming
	fixes.

	* src/athena-application.c: (create_factory):
	Changes caused by the festival of renaming in OAF.
	
2000-08-11  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-sidebar-tabs.c:
	(athena_sidebar_tabs_load_theme_data),
	(athena_sidebar_tabs_hit_test), (measure_total_height),
	(recalculate_size), (athena_sidebar_tabs_size_request),
	(draw_one_tab_plain), (draw_tab_piece_aa), (draw_one_tab_themed),
	(get_tab_width), (draw_pixbuf_tiled_aa), (allocate_cleared_pixbuf),
	(draw_or_layout_all_tabs), (athena_sidebar_tabs_expose):
	added anti-aliased, shadowed labels for themed sidebar tabs, as
	well as off-screen drawing to minimize flashing, fetching the
	font from the theme and improved layout.
	* icons/arlo/arlo.xml:
	added a font for the labels
	* libathena-extensions/athena-gdk-pixbuf-extensions.c:
	(athena_gdk_pixbuf_draw_text):
	added a check for too small a box to draw in to fix a case for
	the sidebar tabs
	
2000-08-11  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(icon_set_position),
	(athena_icon_container_update_scroll_region), (lay_down_icons):
	Handle fixed size icon containers.  Add clipping to icon 
	positioning.  Don't adjust scroll region if the icon container
	is set to a fixed size.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_initialize):
	Set up desktop icon view to a fixed size and set the allocation
	of the widget to be our fixed size with an offset of 0, 0
	
2000-08-11  Ali Abdin  <aliabdin@aucegypt.edu>

        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/ASSUMPTIONS:
        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/TODO:
        Added an ASSUMPTIONS (it might be temporary) and elborated on a TODO
        item.

        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/sect-preparse.c:
        (sect_preparse_figure_start_element) Keep a hash of the figure_id's

2000-08-11  Mike Engber  <engber@eazel.com>

	First cut at syncing our desktop background with GNOME's (bug 1047)
	Still need to handle centered & scaled images + update issues.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-background.c:
	(athena_background_initialize_class):

2000-08-11  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Work on 2061 ("Show Properties" on desktop link files
	should show properties of real volume).

	This essentially works now, but I see some little
	problems that I need to address before marking this
	fixed. Also I haven't done anything about Trash, which
	is definitely a whole can of worms of its own.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(athena_file_rename): Move the check for self-owned
	files after the check for new name & old name identical.
	(athena_file_can_rename): Check for self-owned files
	here too to match _rename.
	* src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c:
	(get_and_ref_file_to_display): New function, determines
	which file to actually display properties given the file
	it's passed. Checks for ATHENA_LINK_HOME and ATHENA_LINK_MOUNT
	type files.
	(fm_properties_window_get_or_create): Call 
	get_and_ref_file_to_display instead of just using the passed file.

2000-08-11  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1891 (calling set_title before report_load_underway has
	no effect).

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c: (destroy):
	Fix a leak in the symbolic link target hash table.
	
	* src/athena-application.c: (athena_application_startup),
	(athena_application_create_desktop_window),
	(athena_application_open_desktop),
	(athena_application_close_desktop),
	(athena_application_destroyed_window),
	(athena_application_create_window):
	Simplified the logic for creating and destroying the desktop
	window a little bit and made it actually unref the desktop
	window instead of just destroying it.
	
	* src/athena-switchable-navigation-bar.c:
	(athena_switchable_navigation_bar_initialize),
	(athena_switchable_navigation_bar_set_mode),
	(athena_switchable_navigation_bar_set_location):
	Added missing code to send out the mode_changed signal and
	took out a gratuitous FIXME.
	
	* src/athena-view-frame.h:
	* src/athena-view-frame.c:
	(athena_view_frame_initialize_class),
	(athena_view_frame_initialize), (athena_view_frame_destroy),
	(set_up_for_new_location), (athena_view_frame_load_location),
	(athena_view_frame_report_location_change),
	(athena_view_frame_set_title), (athena_view_frame_get_title):
	Changed it so the view frame keeps around the title as passed by
	the view. It now emits a "title_changed" signal instead of a
	"set_title" signal and you can get the title with a call to
	athena_view_frame_get_title.
	
	* src/athena-window.h:
	* src/athena-window.c: (athena_window_title_changed_callback),
	(athena_window_connect_view):
	* src/athena-window-manage-views.h:
	* src/athena-window-manage-views.c:
	(athena_window_get_current_location_title),
	(athena_window_update_title),
	(athena_window_set_displayed_location),
	(athena_window_title_changed), (handle_go_elsewhere),
	(athena_window_has_really_changed),
	(athena_window_update_state):
	Manage the title in a simpler way now that the view frame keeps
	the title around.
	
	* src/athena-window-toolbars.c: (set_up_button): Fixed error
	that would result in a call to gnome_stock_set_icon with NULL.

	* RPMs-README: Fixed a typo.

2000-08-11  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1743 (Deleting a file in search results should cause
	list to update appropriately).

	The fix for this involved fixing bugs in athena_file_is_in_trash
	and making emblems behave more flexibly. We now have the ability
	to exclude certain emblems when displaying a file, so that
	the trash emblem shows up in search results but not regular
	list view. A happy side effect of the way this works is that
	the trash emblem now shows up in the sidebar for items (including
	directories) that are anywhere in the trash.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.h: Publicized names
	of emblems AthenaFile adds based on file state, so that
	file-displaying code could choose to exclude some of them.
	This included changing their names to start with ATHENA_
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c: 
	(compare_emblem_names): updated for emblem name changes.
	(athena_file_get_emblem_names): updated for name changes.
	Also, always include EMBLEM_NAME_TRASH for files in trash,
	not just when the file is a search result. Soon we will be
	able to eliminate athena_file_is_search_result entirely.
	(athena_file_is_in_trash): Fixed several problems here.
	Don't bother checking for NULL; use _get_uri not
	_get_activation_uri so the test works at any point in the
	life of a AthenaFile; free the uri string; initialize
	trash_dir_uri so we don't try to unref an uninitialized
	variable in some cases.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-factory.h,
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-factory.c:
	(athena_icon_factory_get_emblem_icons_for_file): Added
	parameter for emblem names to exclude when creating icons.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-string-list.c:
	(athena_string_list_new_from_string_list),
	(athena_string_list_free), (athena_string_list_contains):
	Made these functions allow NULL, as GList does.
	(athena_self_check_string_list): Added tests of NULL handling.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.h: 
	(get_emblem_names_to_exclude): New function pointer for subclasses
	to override.
	(fm_directory_view_get_emblem_names_to_exclude): New function for
	subclasses to call.
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(real_get_emblem_names_to_exclude): New function, returns list
	containing ATHENA_FILE_EMBLEM_NAME_TRASH, so directory views by
	default don't show the trash emblem.
	(fm_directory_view_initialize_class): Wire up 
	get_emblem_names_to_exclude.
	(fm_directory_view_get_emblem_names_to_exclude): New function,
	returns result of possibly overridden function pointer.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (get_icon_images_callback):
	Use fm_directory_view_get_emblem_names_to_exclude when getting
	emblems for each icon.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c:
	(fm_list_view_get_emblem_pixbufs_for_file):
	Use fm_directory_view_get_emblem_names_to_exclude when getting
	emblems for each icon.

	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:
	(fm_search_list_view_initialize_class): Override 
	get_emblem_names_to_exclude with our real_get_emblem_names_to_exclude.
	(real_get_emblem_names_to_exclude): New function, returns NULL, so
	all emblems including the trash emblem will be displayed.

	* src/athena-sidebar-title.c: (update_emblems):
	Pass NULL for emblems-to-exclude when getting emblems for sidebar.

	(icon_set_position), (lay_down_icons),
	(athena_icon_container_initialize),
	(athena_icon_container_set_layout_mode):
	Removed layout code that was being designed for the desktop.
	The desktop has no auto layout at the present.

	(athena_icon_container_get_is_fixed_size),
	(athena_icon_container_set_is_fixed_size):
	New functions to set and get the icon containers
	fixed size attribute.  This attribute should be checked
	whenever an operation that would change the size
	of the container is called.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_initialize):
	Removed layout mode code.

        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/toc-elements.c:
        (toc_title_start_element),
        (toc_title_end_element):
        I tried the GDP Hanbook - Didn't like how the table of contents came
        out. So I tweaked it to further indent the sect3's and give them a
        different HTML tag (H4)

        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/TODO:
        Updated

        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/sect-elements.c:
        (sect_write_characters) An aspect of this function got accidently
        removed causing things to be output when they shouldn't. It took me
        approximately half an hour to find this elusive problem (I may never
        have found it had it not been for an old copy of gnome-db2html2 lying
        around)

2000-08-10  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	I accidentally committed before writing ChangeLog (wrong
	directory). So I'm reconstructing the changes I checked in
	a short while ago with no ChangeLog entry.

	Fixed 2075: (use AthenaFile objects for actual files,
	not symbolic links, in search interface).

	As a happy side effect, this fixed 2027 (thumbnails do not
	display in search results)

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.h,
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_queue_notice_file_change): New function for
	subclasses to call when they want to put a file into the
	changed-files queue (which they usually don't need to since
	for the normal case the superclass handles this stuff)
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: accidental white space 
	change only
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.h:
	(adding_file), (removing_file), (file_still_belongs):
	New function pointers for subclasses to optionally override.
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c:
	(fm_list_view_adding_file): New function, called on each file
	as it is added to the AthenaList; calls overridable function
	pointer.
	(fm_list_view_removing_file): New function, called on each file
	as it is removed from the AthenaList; calls overridable function
	pointer.
	(fm_list_view_file_still_belongs): New function, asks whether changed
	file that was in list should be put back in; calls overridable function
	pointer.
	(real_adding_file): New function, refs file
	(real_removing_file): New function, unrefs file
	(real_file_still_belongs): New function, checks that file is still in
	this directory
	(fm_list_view_initialize_class): wire up these new function pointers
	to their new "real_" implementations
	(add_to_list): call fm_list_view_adding_file instead of just reffing
	(fm_list_view_clear), (remove_from_list): call fm_list_view_removing_file 
	instead of just unreffing; also, remove_from_list now returns a
	boolean for whether the item had been in the list.
	(fm_list_view_file_changed): Only re-insert the file if it had been
	in the list and fm_list_view_file_still_belongs is true.

	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:
	(fm_search_list_view_initialize_class): wire up all the new overridden
	function pointers
	(real_add_file): overridden to get the real file that the funky
	search virtual file refers to, and put the real one in the list view
	(real_adding_file): overridden to start monitoring the file since
	the directory doesn't do it for us in this case
	(real_removing_file): overridden to stop monitoring the file
	(real_file_still_belongs): overridden to return TRUE as long as
	the file still exists

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.h:
	Reverted all of rebecka's recent changes that made opening a
	file in the search list show the real file. This behavior just works
	automatically with no special code in the new design. But it turns
	out I didn't actually need to remove the code to make the new design
	work, because it never would have been called. There's still some
	even older athena-search-result-specific code in here that might
	be completely obsolete now.

2000-08-10  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	added a text color paramter to athena_gdk_pixbuf_draw_text,
	as part of making the sidebar tabs use anti-aliased text, which
	will be checked in soon.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-gdk-pixbuf-extensions.h:
	added a text color parameter to athena_gdk_pixbuf_draw_text

	* libathena-extensions/athena-image.c:
	(athena_image_size_allocate):
	added a black text color parameter in the call to draw_text

	* icons/arlo/arlo.xml:
	Fixed a bad file name

2000-08-10  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2081 (crash changing themes). The problem was that
	the code to unregister the preference callback was doing it
	with the wrong callback data.
	
	* src/athena-window-private.h:
	* src/athena-window-toolbars.c: (set_up_button),
	(set_up_toolbar_images), (set_up_toolbar_images_callback),
	(athena_window_initialize_toolbars),
	(athena_window_toolbar_remove_theme_callback):
	* src/athena-window.c: (athena_window_destroy):
	Unregister the preference callback properly. This required passing
	in the window pointer.

2000-08-10  Rebecca Schulman  <rebecka@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2072, to make the size search field
	have an entry where the user can enter the
	number of "K" they want.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-search-bar-criterion-private.h:
	added field to include labels after the entry in a search
	criterion, if needed
	* libathena-extensions/athena-search-bar-criterion.c:
	(athena_search_bar_criterion_new_from_values),
	(athena_search_bar_criterion_next_new),

	use suffix to create new criteria now, and parse
	the size entry's text to mean K, rather than bytes.
	
	* src/athena-complex-search-bar.c:
	(attach_criterion_to_search_bar):
	attach the suffix as part of the value entry, if it exists.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory.c:
	(athena_directory_get_internal), (athena_directory_get),
	(athena_directory_get_existing): Cleaned up API so that
	internal code can get a directory without creating one.
	(get_parent_directory_if_exists): Used new API to cut down
	code a bit.
	(athena_directory_notify_files_removed),
	(athena_directory_notify_files_moved): Always create a
	AthenaFile object. This results in a bit more work, but is
	more compatible with the 1/2 done symbolic link change notify
	work.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(athena_file_get_internal): Don't create a new directory if
	being called in the mode where we don't create a new file.
	(update_link), (get_link_files),
	(update_links_if_target), (athena_file_update_info),
	(athena_file_mark_gone), (athena_file_emit_changed):
	More work on notifying links about changes to the target file.
	This isn't quite working and isn't required so I'll get back to it
	later. At the moment it is not doing any harm.

 	(mozilla_uris_differ_only_by_fragment_identifier,
 	mozilla_location_changed_callback): Send fake load underway and
 	load done messages to Athena when the new URI differs from the
 	previous only by the fragment identifier (indicating that all we
 	did was change anchors). This allows URI references w/ fragment
 	identifiers to be displayed in the location bar properly.

2000-08-09  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	After this change, you will get a warning each time you exit
	unless you get the new Bonobo with my destroy-notify bug fix.

	Fixed the "metafile read fails" bug. Fixed a bunch of memory
	leaks that I found because I added a new function to get rid
	of hash tables at quit time and there's a hash table with all
	the AthenaDirectory objects in there. I'm only 1/2 done
	with what I'm working on, but people need the "read fails"
	bug fix.

	* components/help/help-method.c: (escape_for_shell),
	(help_uri_to_string): Improve code that constructs URIs so it
	doesn't to excessive escaping.

	read "public" metafiles.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-background.c:

	knows that only the metadata needs to be monitored.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory.c:
	(athena_directory_get): Got rid of silly ref and sink code.
	We don't use the floating feature, so we should just ignore it.
	Use the new function that creates a hash table that should be
	empty and freed on exit. This helps us detect leaks.
	(athena_directory_file_monitor_add): Got rid of incorrect
	code that would reject a caller that didn't supply a callback.
	Callers might want to monitor metadata only, not files.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(athena_file_new_from_name): Got rid of silly ref and sink code.
	We don't use the floating feature, so we should just ignore it.

	a URI to links to that URI.
	(athena_file_new_from_info): Got rid of silly ref and sink code.
	We don't use the floating feature, so we should just ignore it.
	To share more code, call athena_file_update_info as part of
	the implementation here.
	(athena_file_update_info): Maintain the hash table entries as
	the symlink_name field changes.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-glib-extensions.h:

	exit, check that is is empty, and free it at exit time.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.c:
	Got rid of some function-pointer casting.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(call_icon_callback), (athena_icon_container_for_each):
	Added a new call to iterate all the icons in the container.
	Needed so we can unref all the files when we empty it.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-glib-extensions.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-mime-actions.c:

	the files when the icon view is cleared.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: (fm_list_view_clear): Added
	code to get rid of the refs on all the files when the icon view is
	cleared.
	
	* src/file-manager/athena-trash-monitor.h:
	* src/file-manager/athena-trash-monitor.c:
	(athena_trash_monitor_initialize_class), (destroy),
	(unref_trash_monitor), (athena_trash_monitor_get),
	(athena_trash_monitor_is_empty):
	Added code to destroy the trash monitor on exit.
	
	* src/athena-bookmark-list.c:
	(athena_bookmark_list_initialize_class), (stop_monitoring_one),
	(clear), (destroy), (athena_bookmark_list_load_file): Added code
	to clear out the list at destroy time the same way we already did
	before loading a file.
	
	* src/athena-window-menus.c: (free_bookmark_list),
	(get_bookmark_list): Add code to free the global bookmark list
	on exit to help with leak checking.
	(refresh_go_menu): Changed to use GList instead of GSList.
	
	* src/athena-window-private.h:
	* src/athena-window.c: (athena_window_destroy):
	Unref the current_location_bookmark and last_location_bookmark
	to fix a leak.

	history list at exit time to make it easier to spot leaks.
	(athena_window_get_history_list_callback): Change the history
	list to be a GList instead of GSList.

	different criterion from menu. This fixes bug where switching

	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c: (place_home_directory):
	Specify that link is a home link.
	
	* src/athena-desktop-window.c: (athena_desktop_window_new):
	Specify that trash is a trash link.

2000-08-09  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Add support for Mozilla m17.
	
	* configure.in:
	Add some artificial intelligence to detect whether the mozilla
	we are using is m17.
		
	* components/mozilla/Makefile.am:
	Define the mozilla milestone version.
		
	* components/mozilla/athena-mozilla-content-view.c:
	(athena_mozilla_content_view_initialize),
	(debug_print_state_flags), (debug_print_status_flags),
	(mozilla_net_state_callback), (mozilla_net_status_callback),
	(mozilla_progress_callback):

	Update for changes in the mozilla embedding api.  Also, simplify
	the status/state flag debugging stuff a bit.
	
Tue Aug 08 23:23:50 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-mime-actions.c
	  (athena_mime_get_default_application_fo)
	  (athena_mime_get_short_list_application)
	  (athena_mime_get_all_applications_for_u):
	  Use the new application registry api.  Also remove the hack for
	  "merging" (bug 1268) the application with short list as this
	  should now be not necessary because of the application registry.

	* src/athena-sidebar.c (command_button_callback):
	  Use the new application registry api and check for NULL
	  return from get_mime_application just for sanity's sake.

2000-08-08  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(update_label_color):
	removed a debugging statement I inadvertently left in yesterday.
	
2000-08-08  Arlo Rose  <arlo@eazel.com>

	* icons/arlo/arlo.xml:
	Added new hex values for the selection rectangle.

2000-08-08  Robin * Slomkowski  <rslomkow@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/Makefile.am: forgotten headers

2000-08-08  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Did part of the work for bug 1753 (search view should start out
	sorted by search criteria). We're still not sure if this is a
	good UI, but I'll make it possible for us to try it out if it
	isn't too much more work.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: Added a FIXME comment
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.h: Added get_default_sort_attribute
	function pointer.
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: 
	(fm_list_view_initialize_class): Wired up default_sort_attribute
	function pointer.
	(fm_list_view_begin_loading): use get_default_sort_attribute ()
	instead of string constant.
	(get_default_sort_attribute): Dispatch to possibly overridden 
	function pointer.
	(real_get_default_sort_attribute): return "name" (dupe, actually)
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:
	(fm_search_list_view_initialize_class): Wired up 
	get_default_sort_attribute function pointer
	(real_get_default_sort_attribute): return "name" (dupe, actually).
	This gives us the place to decide which attribute to start out
	sorted by. To choose the attribute, we need to define a mapping
	between the search URI and one of the column attributes. I'm
	waiting on this part until mathieu gets farther along with the
	search-URI-to-human-readable-string code, which I hope to
	leverage.

2000-08-08  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-sidebar-tabs.c: (athena_sidebar_tabs_initialize),
	(athena_sidebar_tabs_destroy), (get_tab_width),
	(draw_or_hit_test_all_tabs):
	fixed lots of problems with the arlo-themed sidebar tabs, as well as
	fixing the tab wrapping for the non-arlo ones as well.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(start_rubberbanding):
	implemented Carbamide's suggestion of specifying the select box
	color in the theme.
	* icons/arlo/arlo.xml:
	changed the arlo theme to use a custom select box color, although
	Arlo will probably pick a better one soon.
	
2000-08-08  Ali Abdin  <aliabdin@aucegypt.edu>

        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/gdb3html.c:
        (get_entity): Change a 'gchar' to a 'char'
        
        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/sect-elements.c:
        (sect_menu_start_element): Remove inadvertant comments

        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/sect-elements.[ch]:
        (sect_interface_start_element),
        (sect_interface_end_element): Remove these functions. They were only
        providing CSS tags, but we only provide HTML tags :)

        * components/help/html/help-method.c:
        (transform_file) Try a file with an '.xml' extension (for Docbook XML)

2000-08-08  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.h:
	Fix FIXME 1887 - deleting files is now handled separately,
	get rid of the old version that used a synch gnome vfs call.

2000-08-08  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_real_create_selection_context_menu_items):
	Make the context menu choose between "Move to Trash" and
	"Delete..." in the same way the File menu does.

2000-08-09  Ian McKellar  <yakk@yakk.net.au>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-async.c:
	(new_files_callback):
	Fixed a seg-fault that occured when a drag and drop to a WebDAV
	repository failed (due to permissions or something like that). The
	fixed involved simply checking that the GnomeVFSFileInfo passed to
	the new_files_callback by GnomeVFS was valid.

2000-08-08  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed a couple of problems that yakk ran into that were
	preventing files from opening correctly in WebDAV.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: 
	(file_is_launchable): Check for "can_get_permissions" before
	checking executability. If you can't get the permissions then
	we won't assume the file is launchable.
	(activate_callback): This was launching local executables
	but trying to launch NULL in the remote executable case.
	Reworked to fall through to the non-executable code for remote
	executables.

2000-08-08  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-gdk-extensions.c:
	(athena_get_largest_fitting_font):
	Fixed crasher.  Was always assuming that gdk_font_load would
	return a valid font.  This is not the case.  The code will
	now properly traverse the array to look for the requested
	size. 
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(get_icon_space_height), (lay_down_one_line_vertical),
	(lay_down_icons_horizontal), (lay_down_icons_vertical),
	(lay_down_icons), (relayout), (reload_icon_positions),
	(athena_icon_container_initialize), (finish_adding_new_icons),

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-private.h:
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_initialize):
	Work on making the icon layout code more flexible so that
	we can have differing layout schemes.  This is specifically
	for the desktop layout requirements.
	
2000-08-08  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1749 (Show Properties should be disabled in 
	search results)

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.h: added new function
	pointer supports_properties and new function
	fm_directory_view_supports_properties.
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_initialize_class): Fill in supports_properties 
	function pointer with fm_directory_view_real_supports_properties.
	(compute_menu_item_info): Use fm_directory_view_supports_properties
	to decide whether to make "Show Properties" sensitive.
	(fm_directory_view_supports_properties): New function, calls 
	possibly-overridden function pointer.
	(fm_directory_view_real_supports_properties): New function,
	returns TRUE.
	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:
	(fm_search_list_view_initialize_class): Fill in supports_properties
	function pointer with real_supports_properties.
	(real_supports_properties): return FALSE.

2000-08-08  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed real and potential memory leaks involving
	athena_directory_wait_until_ready.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-mime-actions.c:
	(athena_directory_wait_for_metadata): New function,
	calls _wait_until_ready with no attributes and
	TRUE for metadata, then frees result. The result as
	currently implemented will always be NULL in this case
	but there's no guarantee of that so it's safer to free
	the result.
	
	(athena_mime_get_default_action_type_for_uri),
	(athena_mime_get_default_application_for_uri_internal),

	(athena_mime_set_short_list_components_for_uri),
	(athena_mime_extend_all_applications_for_uri),
	(athena_mime_remove_from_all_applications_for_uri):
	Use athena_directory_wait_for_metadata.
	
	(athena_mime_get_default_component_for_uri_internal),
	(athena_mime_get_all_components_for_uri): free results
	of athena_directory_wait_until_ready.

	(athena_mime_get_short_list_components_for_uri): free
	results of athena_directory_wait_until_ready, also
	removed extra call to _wait_until_ready.

	* CVSVERSION: New file, used to detect whether we are configuring
	a cvs version or a release tarball.
	
	* configure.in: Default -Werror to off when configuring a release
	tarball, and to on when configuring a cvs version.

	* src/athena-zoom-control.c:
	* src/athena-zoom-control.h:

	Revert the subclass change i made.  Turns out its not needed.  The
	fix was to make the Eazel theme grok the "GtkEventBox" style
	class - as all other "nice" themes do.

2000-08-07  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Made preview bug 2017 no longer crash. That's the "Up button
	in search results" one. Darin is planning to make it be
	disabled like it should have been, which is a fix in gnome-vfs.
	Special dispensation from Robin to check this in.

	* src/athena-window.c: (athena_window_go_up): Check for
	NULL parent_uri and bail out if so.

2000-08-07  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Part of bug 2005 (Should display error message when search
	fails because search demon isn't running)

	Rebecka did all the underlying error-code-handling, which isn't
	quite working yet. I'm checking in this UI step even in advance
	of that.

	* src/athena-applicable-views.h: New AthenaNavigationResult
	ATHENA_NAVIGATION_RESULT_SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE. This mechanism,
	invented by me, seems really hoary now.
	* src/athena-applicable-views.c:
	(get_athena_navigation_result_from_gnome_vfs_result):
	Translate beween GnomeVFSResult and AthenaNavigationResult.
	* src/athena-window-manage-views.c: 
	(is_search_uri): New function, checks whether the URI starts
	with "search:".
	(athena_window_end_location_change_callback): If the error
	is SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE and it's a search uri, put up a custom
	error message. It's not a very helpful message at this point, but 
	at least the user gets some kind of feedback.

2000-08-07  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed "make check".

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory.c:
	(athena_self_check_directory): Fixed a self check that no longer
	matched the code.
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(athena_file_compare_for_sort),
	(athena_file_compare_for_sort_reversed): Fixed a bug that was
	causing reverse sorts to work wrong (caught by self check).
	* libathena-extensions/athena-string.c:
	(athena_str_get_prefix), (athena_self_check_string):
	Fixed some incorrect self checks and a small error in get_prefix
	that was exposed by a self check.

2000-08-07  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bugs 1985 and 1986 (infinite loops using Mozilla).
	Both were triggered by the fact that Mozilla reports that
	it is done before it reports that it is underway. Made
	the state machine less picky about this.
	
	* src/athena-window-manage-views.c:
	(athena_window_set_state_info): Made the "DONE" state
	also do all the "INITIAL" state work so that reporting
	you are done before you report that you started does not
	cause any trouble.
	
	* docs/recommended-books.html: Fixed a bad URL in here.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-list.c:
	(athena_list_set_single_click_mode): Fixed formatting.
	
	* src/athena-window.c: (athena_window_go_home):
	Use real function to convert path to URI instead of just
	prepending "file://".

2000-08-07  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Fix bug 2019.  Zoom control doesnt play nicely with gtk theme
	backgrounds.
	
	* src/athena-zoom-control.h:
	Subclass this beast from GtkMisc instead of GtkEventBox to get all
	the default widget behaviors.

	* src/athena-zoom-control.c:
	(athena_zoom_control_initialize_class),
	(athena_zoom_control_initialize), (draw_zoom_control_image),
	(athena_zoom_control_draw), (athena_zoom_control_expose):

	Change the code that drew the symbol backgrounds to clear their
	area instead of drawing a box.  This causes the default
	background to be rendered instead of a blank area ironically.

	Also, clear the background before drawing the widget so that the
	we get the same effect as above on the whole widget.

	Fixed bug 1979 (Crash involving bookmarks)

	Gene did all the hard work of finding a reproducible case
	for this. From there it was easy for me to fix the bug
	in code I wrote. He gets 3/4 of all klocs assigned for
	this bug.

	* src/athena-window-menus.c: 
	(athena_window_remove_bookmarks_menu_items):

	items from bookmarks menu.
	(refresh_all_bookmarks): 
	Call athena_window_remove_bookmarks_menu_items instead 
	of lower-level remove_bookmarks_after.

	  Redo drawing buffered background, stop using a widget, and
	  allocate the gc and the offscreen pixmap only for the draw
	  and free them afterwards.  Also do the buffered draw in an idle
	  handler to avoid too many draws.  Obscoletes bug 614.

	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c (remove_from_list):
	  Instead of a warning just ignore the file if it's not in
	  the list anymore.  This is what the icon view does and
	  apparently we can get multiple file_changed calls which
	  will cause this.  Fixes bug 1961

2000-08-07  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Fix bug 1903.  Pick a better sidebar font.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-gdk-extensions.c:
	(athena_get_largest_fitting_font):

	Change the number of sizes to choose from to 4 (from 5).  Also,
	remove the 28 size which is usually unavailable.  This size is what
	was causing the ugliness in the font.
	
	* src/athena-sidebar-title.c: (update_font):

	Changed the font to bold.

2000-08-07  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1969 enough for now (search bar buttons should
	become sensitive & insensitive appropriately). Will write
	up bug reports about remaining issues.

	Made the "Find" button only be sensitive if all text-entry
	fields are non-empty. (Did this for both simple & complex
	search bar). Cleaned up some other code that I couldn't
	avoid in there too.

	* src/athena-simple-search-bar.c:
	Define Details struct.
	(athena_simple_search_bar_initialize_class): Wire up
	destroy handler.
	(search_text_is_invalid): New function, returns TRUE if the
	text is empty.
	(update_simple_find_button_state): New function, sets the
	sensitivity of the find button based on search_text_is_invalid.
	(activated_search_field): New function, calls location_changed
	only if text is valid.
	(athena_simple_search_bar_initialize): Initialize Details field;
	change "activate" signal on text field to call 
	activated_search_field instead of calling location_changed directly
	so it can handle the text-invalid case; wired "change" signal of
	text field to update_simple_find_button_state; call update_simple_
	find_button_state once after setting up widgets; simplify
	widget-creation code.
	(athena_simple_search_bar_destroy): Free details field.
	(athena_simple_search_bar_set_location),
	(athena_simple_search_bar_get_location): Updated to use Details.
	* src/athena-simple-search-bar.h: Replaced several fields in 
	AthenaSimpleSearchBar struct with new Details field. Among
	the replaced fields were some undo-related ones that were not
	yet used anywhere, so I left them out of Details.

	* src/athena-complex-search-bar.c:
	(criteria_invalid): Walks through the list of criteria, checking
	whether any of the text-field ones have empty text. Later we
	could add other types of checks in here.
	(update_options_buttons_state): Just added FIXME comment.
	(update_find_button_state): New function, sets sensitivity
	of find button based on criteria_invalid.
	(update_dynamic_buttons_state): New function, calls the other
	two button-updating functions.
	(athena_complex_search_bar_initialize_class): Wire up destroy 
	handler.
	(more_options_callback), (fewer_options_callback), 
	(athena_complex_search_bar_initialize): 
	Call update_dynamic_buttons_state instead of just 
	update_options_buttons_state.
	(athena_complex_search_bar_destroy): free Details struct. This
	was leaking before.
	(attach_criterion_to_search_bar): Attach update_find_button_state
	to "changed" signal of any new text-entry field.
	
2000-08-07  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-sidebar-title.c:
	(nautlius_sidebar_title_select_text_color):
	Darin suggested that we make the sidebar echo the icon view's
	use of color to distinguish the name from the additional info,
	so I did it.

	'interface' tag.

        (sect_link_start_element),
        (sect_link_end_element): Two new functions for the 'link' tag

        (sect_menu_start_element),
        (sect_menu_end_element): Two new functions for the 'guisubmenu' and
        'guimenu' tags. These are needed because the previous implementation
        was incorrect.

        Also the prototypes for the above functions and added the following
        tags: interface, link, menuchoice (yes menuchoice is back!)

        Modified the guimenu/guisubmenu tag to only be bold and display the
        'arrow' if they are enclosed in the menuchoice tag. If they are not
        enclosed, just 'print' the characters. This is how jade (a.k.a db2html
        does it)

2000-08-07  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	Fix bug 1941 -- Context menus need to be clicked twice.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-gtk-extensions.c:
	(athena_pop_up_context_menu):
	* libathena-extensions/athena-gtk-extensions.h:
	When invoked from anywhere but the button_press call, we need to
	pass 0 for button otherwise the next click will not be handled.
	Add a way to pass the button as a parameter.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_pop_up_selection_context_menu),
	(fm_directory_view_pop_up_background_context_menu):
	Pass 0 for button
	
	* src/athena-sidebar.c: (athena_sidebar_press_event):
	* src/athena-window-toolbars.c:
	(back_or_forward_button_clicked_callback):
	Called from button_press, pass the actual button.
	
2000-08-07  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1422 (dropping an icon at the edge doesn't update
	the scrollable area)

	Start of bug 1969 (search controls need to adjust sensitivity
	appropriately)

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(athena_icon_container_update_scroll_region): Renamed from
	"update_scroll_region" since it's now in a header file.
	(relayout), (athena_icon_container_clear): Updated for name change.
	(athena_icon_container_move_icon): Added FIXME about how
	update_scroll_region is handled at different levels at Darin's
	request.
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-private.h:
	Put prototype for athena_icon_container_update_scroll_region
	here so it could be called from drag-and-drop code.
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-dnd.c: (handle_local_move):
	Update scroll region after drag.
	
	* src/athena-complex-search-bar.c:
	(update_options_buttons_state): New function, updates the sensitivity
	of "Fewer Choices" button based on number of displayed criteria. Later
	it will also handle "More Choices" button and perhaps others.
	(athena_complex_search_bar_initialize): 
	Call update_options_button_state after creating button widgets.
	(more_options_callback), (fewer_options_callback): Call
	update_options_button_state when number of criteria changes.

2000-08-07  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1921 (reloading does not cause directory count to be
	recomputed)

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-async.c:
	(metafile_read_failed), (get_corresponding_file),
	(athena_directory_force_reload):
	Make the force reload call also force recomputing the counts (both
	shallow and deep) for that directory.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file-private.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:

	that won't create a new one.

2000-08-07  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1906 (text size under icons is not always correct)

	* libathena-extensions/athena-font-factory.c:
	(font_hash_node_lookup_with_insertion): Inserting a font into
	the font cache hashtable was passing the wrong pointer for the
	font name: name (which is reused each time in this routine) instead
	of node->name (which is part of the hash table node and won't change).
	Also took off unnecessary gpointer and gconstpointer casts. Darin
	spotted the problem after I aimed him at this function.

Mon Aug 07 05:00:55 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-list.c (athena_list_draw):
	  Call gtk_widget_draw on the title widget.  This fixes the problem
	  where the widget is not drawn when the list view is first selected.

Mon Aug 07 00:31:50 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-glib-extensions.c
	  (athena_get_system_time):  use G_GINT64_CONSTANT instead of LL
	  to be more "alpha clean"

	* libathena-extensions/athena-list-column-title.c
	  (athena_list_column_title_initialize)
	  (athena_list_column_title_finalize) (get_column_frame_at)

	  (athena_list_column_title_paint):  Don't use GnomePixmap just
	  for loading pixmaps, this doesn't work always (read doesn't work
	  on my machine), plus it's a horrible hack.  Use GdkPixbuf to load
	  up the sort indicator pixmaps.  The title_window of the clist
	  scrolls itself horizontally, so don't add the horizontal scroll
	  again during painting.  Fix text not always redrawing some 2 pixel
	  stripes because we were clipping the redrawing rectangle rather
	  then only the outside of the cell.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-list.c (athena_list_initialize)
	  (athena_list_flush_typeselect_state) (athena_list_realize):
	  use G_GINT64_CONSTANT instead of LL.  Use
	  gtk_widget_push/pop_composite_child when creating the column title
	  Check existance of list->details->title rather then
	  clist->title_window when adding it to clist->title_window as
	  clist->title_window will always exist.

2000-08-06  Mathieu Lacage <mathieu@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-search-bar-criterion.c:

2000-08-06  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(athena_file_get_emblem_names):
	make intrinsic emblems appear in the list after the assigned ones because
	the assigned ones are more important to the user.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(athena_icon_canvas_item_initialize_class),
	(draw_or_measure_label_text):

	drawing it in a different color
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(athena_icon_container_get_label_color), (update_label_color):
	set up the file name color and the additional info color separately
	return one or the other based on parameter passed in to get_label_color
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.h:
	added an additional parameter to get_label_color to select which color to return
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-private.h:
	added a new field for the additional info color

2000-08-05  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	fixed embedded icon text clarity (we were using helvetica 9, which wasn't installed
	on many machines, and the scaled version looked hideous).  Fixed by using the
	bigger, more commonly installed helvetica 24 font, then scaling it down using the
	gdk_pixbuf compositing routines, which exploit the gray-scale.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-gdk-pixbuf-extensions.h:
	added a "font_scale" parameter
	* libathena-extensions/athena-gdk-pixbuf-extensions.c:
	(athena_gdk_pixbuf_draw_text):
	used the font scale parameter to scale up the buffer, and scale it down when
	compositing
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-factory.c: (embed_text):
	change the default size to 24 pt, and used a scale factor of .333 for the
	equivalent of an 8 point font
	* libathena-extensions/athena-image.c:
	(athena_image_size_allocate):
	added a font scale parameter of 1.0.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-undo-manager.c: (corba_append),
	(athena_undo_manager_undo):
	Fixed a bug where transaction)in_progress was always TRUE.
	This caused a g_warning to always be fired.  I guess no one
	noticed because we aren't exercising the undo code.
	
	* libathena/athena-undo-transaction.c:
	(remove_transaction_from_object),
	(athena_undo_transaction_add_atom),
	(athena_undo_transaction_add_to_undo_manager),
	(remove_atoms_cover),
	(athena_undo_transaction_unregister_object):
	Fixed bug 1984, crash when closing window after an undo operation.
	This crash is caused by a bogus transaction being left
	in the target objects transaction list.  An assert is thrown
	because the item in the list is not a transaction.  I suspect it
	is the sad remains of an unrefed transaciton that is still in
	the list somehow.  I made a work arund by checking before
	freeing, but need Darin's help to figure out the true cause.

2000-08-05  Ali Abdin  <aliabdin@aucegypt.edu>

        In summary, get Docbook XML working. Support JPEG images. Make PNG
        default image. Fix the GUIMENU/GUISUBMENU tags.

        * components/help/help-method.c: 
        (help_uri_to_string),
        (convert_file_to_uri):
        Support text/xml as a possible help file (Docbook XML). Also if we
        don't recognize the help file, mark it as 'UNKNOWN_FILE' and handle it
        gracefully (should now not reach g_assert_not_reached in the code)

        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/gdb3html.h,
        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/sect-elements.c,
        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/toc-elements.c:
        Add the "articleinfo" tag to act just like the "artheader" tag (the
        former is Docbook XML and the latter is Docbook SGML).

        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/sect-elements.c:
        (sect_graphic_start_element): Small fix to match Eazel style
        guidelines. Add support for JPEG/JPG image types. Make PNG the default
        image type if the 'format' attribute in the graphic element is not
        found.
        (sect_b_arrow_end_element): New function.
        
        Also - removed MENUCHOICE tag, and made GUIMENU and GUISUBMENU use
        sect_b_arrow_end_element.

2000-08-04  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	made it default to using the anti-aliased canvas

	(athena_icon_container_set_zoom_level),

	Changed relayout so it will update the scroll region. This fixes
	bug 1907 (layout options sometimes move icons out of window).
	
	* libathena/athena-clipboard.c: (add_menu_items_callback):
	Fix leak of remote UI handler. This fixes the rest of bug 1259,
	which was just a bug about the FIXME that said "remote UI handler
	leaks here, right?".

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-async.c: (lacks_info),
	(get_info_callback): Fixed infinite loop when you hit a file and
	you can't get info for it. Related to the bug Mike Fleming is
	looking at.
	
2000-08-04  Robey Pointer  <robey@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file-utilities.c:

	* src/athena-window-menus.c: (help_menu_about_athena_callback):

2000-08-04  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed unreported crash-at-boot bug I ran into when
	I turned MALLOC_CHECK_=2 on. This is a good thing for
	everyone to run with (unless it slows things down hideously,
	which it doesn't seem to).

	* src/athena-simple-search-bar.c:
	(athena_simple_search_criteria_to_search_uri):
	This function (apologies to Pavel) crashed like a Russian
	helicopter and leaked like a Russian submarine. Fixed an off-by-one
	bug in a g_new0 that was trashing memory; removed another g_new0
	call that was just leaking its results; called g_strfreev to
	free the results of a g_strsplit call.

2000-08-04  Michael Engber  <engber@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:

	computed canvas_width wrong. bug #1929

2000-08-04  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(athena_icon_canvas_item_render):
	fixed bug 1849, left edge of icons sometime get chopped off in
	anti-aliased mode. Fixed by truncating the offset in the
	affine transfer to integers.
	
2000-08-04  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(bonobo_control_activate_callback): Fix bug where we would leak
	a remote UI handler. This caused bad problems when opening and
	closing windows with the undo management. This fixes bugs 1949
	and 1259.
	
	* src/athena-window-private.h:
	* src/athena-window.c: (athena_window_destroy):
	* src/athena-window-menus.c: (append_bookmark_to_menu),
	(athena_window_remove_go_menu_callback),
	(athena_window_remove_bookmarks_menu_items),
	(athena_window_remove_go_menu_items):
	Fix bookmark signals to properly disconnect when the window goes
	away. The old way of using connect_while_alive would not work
	because we need to disconnect the signals one at a time sometimes
	too and it's illegal to disconnect a "while_alive" signal any
	other way.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-async.c:
	(metafile_write_failure_close_callback),
	(metafile_write_success_close_callback), (metafile_write_callback):

2000-08-04  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* components/mozilla/athena-mozilla-content-view.c
	(mozilla_load_location_callback): Removes
	athena_view_report_load_complete call from here...
	(mozilla_progress_callback): And move it here, because we only
	want to make that call after all the various report_progress
	calls. This fixes bugs 1933 and 1955. Pavel did most of the heavy
	lifting of figuring out why this was killing the state machine.

2000-08-04  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-background.c:
	(athena_background_draw_flat_box),
	(athena_background_set_widget_style):
	fixed bug where setting the sidebar to a solid color background
	wouldn't work; fixed by allowing athena_background to handle
	that case instead of inheriting.
	
	* src/athena-property-browser.c: (format_name_for_display):
	at Susan's suggestion, don't draw the name for the reset background
	property, to better distinguish it from the others (and its name
	is part of its image, anyway)

	* components/hardware/athena-hardware-view.c (setup_form_title):
	  Check result of gnome_pixmap_file.  If NULL, we can't make a new
	  gnome-pixmap.

	* components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/sect-elements.c
	  (sect_get_infobox_logo) (sect_infobox_start_element):
	  sect_get_infobox_logo can return a NULL so check its return
	  and if NULL just add %s instead of <IMG ...>

	* components/services/vault/command-line/vault-operations.c,
	  libathena-extensions/athena-list.c:
	  add #include <string.h>

	* cut-n-paste-code/freetype/ftcalc.h,
	  cut-n-paste-code/freetype/ftconfig.h:  Well even though this
	  is cut and paste code I NEED to add this patch for it to even
	  compile on alpha, I'll try to get this upstream.  The only changes
	  are inside #ifdefs on platforms where long is 64 bit so it should
	  not affect intel code at all.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file-utilities.c
	  (athena_format_uri_for_display):  use g_strdup instead of strdup
	  as then g_free is used and this would really confuse glib in memory
	  checking mode.


	* librsvg/art_render_mask.c, librsvg/rsvg-bpath-util.c,
	  librsvg/rsvg-ft.c: add #include <string.h>

	* src/Makefile.am: define ATHENA_PIXMAPDIR.  This is neccessary for
	  both making the tarballs and actual code sanity on switching
	  toolbar themes etc.  In GNOME 2.0 the GNOME_PATH can be sanely used
	  to allow relocatable athena binary, but in 1.[02] this is the
	  correct way to do things.

	* src/athena-complex-search-bar.c
	  (athena_complex_search_bar_initialize)
	  (load_find_them_pixmap_widget):  If we can't load pixmaps don't
	  add them.  Also don't hardcode "/gnome/share" prefix and use
	  the ATHENA_PIXMAPDIR define to find search.png AND make sure
	  we can load it before using it.

	* src/athena-window-toolbars.c (find_toolbar_child) (setup_button)
	  In toolbar_info use the ATHENA_PIXMAPDIR define to find pixmaps.
	  remove get_stock_callback and get_stock_widget as those functions
	  were an incredible hack and were likely to break.  Replace with a
	  function which searches the toolbar children and then finds correct
	  icon widget.  It also doesn't do anything if there is no icon.  In
	  setup button, use ATHENA_PIXMAPDIR to define pixmaps by their
	  full name.  If we cannot set the stock widget icon, then the icon
	  is not registered and we register it with gnome-stock.
	  Miraculously the current code worked but only worked because the
	  eazel theme was set up in the toolbar_info, other themes with
	  outside images would break.

2000-08-04  Arlo Rose  <arlo@eazel.com>

	* icons/arlo/Makefile.am:
	* icons/arlo/i-regular.xml:
	* icons/arlo/i-directory.xml:
	For the demo, I've added some data to these xml files
	so text shows up on my icons, and emblems get placed
	correctly on my temporary folders.

2000-08-04  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-gdk-pixbuf-extensions.c:
	(athena_gdk_pixbuf_load):
	fixed demo bug #1944, athena doesn't thumbnail xpms.  Fixed
	by making athena_gdk_pixbuf_load using
	athena_gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file for local files, since that
	works better than using the loaders.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-factory.c:
	removed FIXME that was already fixed.
2000-08-04  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file-utilities.c:
	(athena_get_uri_from_local_path): fixes bug 1936.
	athena_get_uri_from_local_path has been made NULL proof.

2000-08-04  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-window.c: (athena_window_hide_sidebar),
	(athena_window_show_sidebar): fixes bug 1881. add special
	case tests.

2000-08-04  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* components/html/glibwww-init.c:
	Added a declaration to work around a bug or version issue that
	some Solaris hackers ran into with glibwww.
	* components/mozilla/main.c: (mozilla_check_environment):
	Fixed a bug where we g_free the result of g_getenv.
	* helper-utilities/authenticate/athena-authenticate-pam.c:
	Changed includes so this builds for some Solaris versions
	(doesn't seem to create any problem compiling elsewhere).
	* libathena-extensions/athena-list.c:
	(athena_list_clear_from_row): Got rid of an overzealous
	assert that wasn't doing us any good.
	* src/athena-first-time-druid.c: (set_up_user_level_page):
	Fixed a broken assert.

2000-08-04  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed demo bug 1908: Title in sidebar vanishes on theme change.

	* src/athena-sidebar.c: 
	(athena_sidebar_set_uri), (athena_sidebar_update_info): 
	Separated update_info into the parts that were about changing 
	URI-based information and the parts that were about changing 
	appearance only. The appearance-only parts are now called
	athena_sidebar_update_appearance. The	other parts were put 
	back into athena_sidebar_set_uri.
	(athena_sidebar_theme_changed),
	(receive_dropped_color), (receive_dropped_keyword),
	(background_appearance_changed_callback): Made these callers
	use athena_sidebar_set_appearance. The bug was that
	theme_changed was passing NULL for the initial title text,
	but passing NULL wipes it out rather than doing nothing as
	was intended. The other callers were getting the current title
	text and then passing it back in; now they just leave it alone.

2000-08-04  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-sidebar-title.c: (update_font):
	Revert the font change since the font I picked is not available on
	all platforms.  Ill make a better fix soon.  In the mean time this
	should fix the torrent of assertions.
	
2000-08-04  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	first draft at the 1744 and 1761 tasks.
	They depend on another one I have to finish first to mek them 
	work.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(athena_file_get_emblem_names), (athena_file_is_directory),
	(athena_file_is_in_trash): add athena_file_is_in_trash
	add test on search results to see if they are from the trash.
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.h: add athena_file_is_in_trash
	* libathena-extensions/athena-search-bar-criterion.c: 
	(athena_search_bar_criterion_human_from_uri): add function.
	* libathena-extensions/athena-search-bar-criterion.h: add function.
	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c: (begin_loading_callback),
	(fm_search_list_view_initialize): hoook onto the directoryview signals
	to tell the view that the title is a new better one.
	* src/athena-simple-search-bar.c:

2000-08-04  Rebecca Schulman  <rebecka@eazel.com>

	* components/music/athena-music-view.c: (sort_by_title),
	(sort_by_artist):
	Fixed bug 1940, where the music view crashed when 
	sorting by title or artist if the id3 tag was incomplete

2000-08-04  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* components/music/athena-music-view.c:
	(athena_music_view_destroy),
	(athena_music_view_drag_data_received):
	fixed bug 1910, there is no way to stop a song once you leave the
	music view, fixed by taking the coward's way out and stopping the
	song when the music view is exited/destroyed.  We can do better post 1.0.
	
2000-08-04  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	Fix bugs 1524 and 1517:

	* components/tree/athena-tree-model.c:
	(athena_tree_model_monitor_add): Fixed a minor bug which made
	this never report anything but the root node.
	Also: moved all helper functions to the end of the file and prototyped
	them, and did minor cleanup.

	* components/tree/athena-tree-view.c (insert_hack_node,
	remove_hack_node, freeze_if_have_hack_node): Functions to handle
	adding and removing the hack node, and freezing while it might be
	visible; this way we should be able to avoid the user ever seeing
	it.
	(athena_tree_view_insert_model_node,
	athena_tree_view_model_done_loading_callback,
	athena_tree_view_load_from_filesystem, tree_expand_callback):
	Use the above functions to insert and hide the hack node at the
	proper times.
	(athena_tree_view_initialize,
	athena_tree_view_update_all_icons): Connect to icons_changed
	signal and update all icons when it happens.

2000-08-04  Rebecca Schulman  <rebecka@eazel.com>

	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: (fm_list_view_compare_rows),
	(add_to_list):
	Fixed irritating cast == NULL messages that appeared by
	the ton in the list view.  

2000-08-03  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Fix bug 1903
	
	* src/athena-sidebar-title.c: (update_font):

	Pick a better font for the sidebar title.  Also ammended the FIXME
	blurb (and the bug too) to make the code robust enough to deal
	with bogus and non-existent fonts.

2000-08-03  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* icons/arlo/arlo.xml:
	* src/athena-zoom-control.c: (draw_number):
	fixed bug 1897, zoom control numbers draw in wrong place when search bar mode switches.
	Fixed by removing an offset that shouldn't have been added to position, and tweaked a
	position in the theme file that was mistakenly compensating.
	
	* components/music/mpg123_handler.c:
	a little bit of work fixing music view problems, more coming soon.
	
2000-08-03  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Fix bug 1905.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.c:
	(global_preferences_create_dialog),
	(sidebar_panel_iid_is_in_default_list),
	(global_preferences_register_sidebar_panels),
	(global_preferences_register_speed_tradeoff_with_defaults),
	(global_preferences_register),
	(athena_global_preferences_initialize):

	The problem was that the sidebar loser component was showing up by
	default.  I added a hard coded list of default sidebar panel
	iids.  Unfortunately, there is not place to query this list, so
	for now its builtin to athena.  Any sidebar panel that is not on
	this list will not be on by default.

	I also fixed some dumb localization, naming and documentation
	things while in the neighborhood.
	
2000-08-03  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Fix bugs 1890 and 1902.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.c:
	(global_preferences_get_dialog),
	(global_preferences_register_for_ui),
	(athena_global_preferences_dialog_update),
	(athena_global_preferences_initialize):
	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.h:

	Expose the initialization call once again.  I suppose explicit
	initialzation was a dream.  It seems to break everytime we add
	something new at startup that needs preferences, so lets just make
	sure preferences defaults exist once and for all.
	
	* src/athena-application.c: (athena_application_initialize),
	(athena_application_destroy), (athena_application_startup),
	(check_for_and_run_as_super_user), (need_to_show_first_time_druid):

	Change the way we check whether the first time wizrard needs to be
	presented.  Instead of checking for the user's 'top' directory, we
	check a flag file: ~/.athena/first-time-wizard.

	Checking the user's top directory doesnt work after my last
	preferences changes, since the preferences initialization call i
	added causes the 'top' directory to exist and this confuses the
	first time druid.

	Fixed bug 1927, Need a way to identify mount links as special
	type of link.

	Fixed bug 1926, Old mount links should be cleaned up
	when desktop launches.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-volume-monitor.c:
	(athena_volume_monitor_destroy), (add_mount_link_property),
	(athena_volume_monitor_is_volume_link):
	Mount links are now tagged with a special XML attribute
	when they are created.

2000-08-03  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-search-bar-criterion.c:
	(athena_search_bar_criterion_next_new): Checked in this
	fix for Mathieu -- Josh noticed that hitting "More Choices"
	enough times would crash; an index needed to be modulo-ized.

2000-08-03  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-switchable-search-bar.c:
	(athena_switchable_search_bar_initialize): connect the simple 
	search bar and the copmlex search bar location_changed signals
	to the switchable search bar.

	* src/athena-sidebar-title.c:
	(athena_sidebar_title_initialize_class), (update_font),
	(update_title), (athena_sidebar_title_size_allocate):
	Added code to update the font when the sidebar's size changes
	since the font is based on the available space. Fixes bugs
	1922 and 1901, I think.
	(athena_sidebar_title_hit_test_icon): Added a return_if_fail.
	
	* src/athena-window-menus.c: (append_bookmark_to_menu):
	Fixed a problem I ran into where the signal was still connected
	after the window was destroyed.

2000-08-03  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* check-signals.pl: Wrote a script to check for people who forget

	and that was already fixed by the time I got around to checking
	this in.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-async.c:
	(get_info_callback): Added a code to check the error result from
	get_file_info. Without this, we were doing
	
	* src/athena-sidebar-title.c: (athena_sidebar_title_set_uri):
	Fixed it so we won't destroy and then instantly recreate the same
	AthenaFile if the URI is set to the same value.

	* components/tree/athena-tree-node-private.h: Forgot to check
	this in.

2000-08-03  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	Rewrote the tree view to do model/view separation, and in the
	process fixed bugs 1519, 1520, 1526, 1529, 1531 and 1522. Some of these
	are not for the current milestone, but just fell out naturally
	from doing the model/view separation, which makes the remaining

	the public metafile. Finally, do metafile writes completely
	based on the preference, not which metafile was read.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory.c:
	(athena_directory_destroy), (construct_private_metafile_uri),

	(athena_file_compare_for_sort_internal):
	(athena_file_get_string_attribute), Got rid of "real_name"

	Refactored the list view code so that the search list view
	doesn't have to replicate anything and can just describe the
	differences between it and the non-search list view. I was
	able to get rid of a lot of complexity while doing this.
	Changed to use the new "name" and "directory" instead of the
	old "real_name" and "real_directory" at the same time.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory.c:
	(athena_directory_is_search_directory):
	Took out "gnome-trash:" which doesn't belong in here. We are doing

	(athena_radio_button_group_set_entry_description_text):
	Added g_return_if_fails if details->horizontal is true
	(because the horizontal layout doesn't have a place to
	put an icon or longer description; we could change that
	later if we needed to)

	* libathena-extensions/athena-preferences-item.h:
	Added new ATHENA_PREFERENCE_ITEM_SHORT_ENUM type for
	preferences dialog, to be used when the choices are small
	enough to fit in one row.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-graphic-effects.c:
	(draw_frame_row), (draw_frame_column), (stretch_frame_image):
	rewrote stretch_frame_image to stretch the frame properly, by repeating the
	area between the corners, instead of stretching the whole pixmap, which made it
	blurry and uneven.
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(draw_or_measure_label_text):

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(athena_icon_container_initialize),
	(athena_icon_container_get_label_color), (update_label_color):

2000-07-31  Rebecca Schulman  <rebecka@eazel.com>
	Rewrote the search list view subclass to be
	more functional, and fixed most of the inheritance

	wrong columns still, but the data in them is readable
	and correct.

2000-07-31  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	fixed bug 1034 and 1460, which were really the same bug: icon text
	gets drawn when it shouldn't be when icons are scaled.  This also
	made the icon text rectangles wrong at different scale factors.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-factory.c:
	(get_themed_icon_file_path), (load_specific_image),
	(scale_image_and_rectangle), (load_image_with_embedded_text):
	scale_image_and_rectangle used the icon width for the text
	rectangle width, which was wrong - fixed by computing them
	separately.  Also, some small clean-ups.

	Finished rest of bug 762 (Framework for dealing with
	component that crashes). Remaining component-failure issues
	have been split off as separate bugs.

	* src/athena-sidebar.c: (athena_sidebar_remove_panel),
	* src/athena-view-frame.c: (check_object):
	Just added FIXME comments with bug numbers.
	
	* src/athena-window-manage-views.c:
	(report_sidebar_panel_failure_to_user):
	Turned this from a placeholder to a real function that puts up
	a sensible error message.
	(athena_window_update_state): Moved the report_to_user call
	to a place where it is hit in all the error cases, not just some.
	
	* src/athena-window.c:
	(window_update_sidebar_panels_from_preferences):
	Call athena_window_disconnect_view on sidebar panel before
	removing it the normal way so that it doesn't trigger the
	report-error-to-user code.

2000-07-28  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Mostly some tweaking on the recent link file work.

	* data/top/Makefile.am: Install the new ".link" files.
	* data/top/Computer: Renamed from Computer.link and added the new stuff
	needed for the MIME magic.
	* data/top/Computer.link: [deleted]
	* data/top/Services: Renamed from Services.link and added the new stuff
	needed for the MIME magic.
	* data/top/Services.link: [deleted]

	* components/tree/athena-tree-view.c: (queue_pending_files):
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(athena_file_get_string_attribute):
	Get rid of all use of athena_link_get_display_name since
	links all have plain names now.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-async.c:
	(set_up_request_by_file_attributes): Fix bug that was causing the
	program to get the activation URI for every single icon.  Lots of
	extra I/O! Also changed it to get the file info first since the
	activation URI is now based on MIME type.
	(lacks_activation_uri): Don't try to get the activation URI until
	after the file info is there.
	(activation_uri_done),
	(activation_uri_read_done),
	(activation_uri_athena_link_read_callback),
	(activation_uri_gmc_link_read_callback),
	(start_getting_activation_uris):
	Changed the code to read the activation URI to use MIME type,
	so now it doesn't have to open every file just to find out if it's
	a GMC link.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file-utilities.c:
	(athena_get_desktop_directory): Get rid of a tiny bit of dead code.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(athena_file_contains_text): No need to special-case the link
	file any more because its MIME type will now make it clear it's
	not a text file.  Also removed athena_file_activate_custom since
	it's not needed any more and moved the logic into
	fm-directory-view.c.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-factory.c:
	(athena_icon_factory_get_icon_for_file): Added FIXMEs.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-link-set.c:
	(athena_link_set_install): Changed comments to not call link files
	".link" files.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.c:
	(global_preferences_register_for_ui): Removed the
	ATHENA_PREFERENCES_SHOW_REAL_FILE_NAME preference since we no
	longer have to lie about file names to make ".link" files
	palatable.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-link.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-link.c: (athena_link_create):
	Added code that notifies the AthenaFile framework that a new file
	has been created, so callers don't have to worry about that.
	(athena_link_is_link_file): Simplified the code -- turned it into
	a one-liner.
	(athena_link_set_icon): The old code had half AthenaFile calls
	and half sync. I/O. Got rid of the AthenaFile stuff. Also put the
	code in to notify the AthenaFile framework about the change to
	the file.
	(athena_link_get_root_property): Added FIXME.
	(athena_link_get_additional_text): Added FIXME.
	(athena_link_get_link_uri): Added FIXME.
	Removed athena_link_get_display_name since it's not needed.
	
	* src/athena-desktop-window.c: (athena_desktop_window_new):
	Fixed GnomeVFSURI leak and turned a GnomeVFSURI into a text URI
	with gnome_vfs_uri_to_string, rather than gnome_vfs_uri_get_path
	which will not do anything useful.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(mount_device_mount), (place_home_directory): Use
	athena_get_uri_from_local_path instead of just sticking a
	"file://" prefix on. Simplified by putting code to notify about
	the link file into the link file create function. Some other
	code cleanups and fixes of path/URI confusion.
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_initialize): Use ATHENA_N_ELEMENTS.
	(fm_directory_view_display_selection_info), (queue_pending_files):
	Get rid of use of athena_link_get_display_name.
	(activate_callback): Added code to handle "command:" URIs, which
	used to be in athena_file_activate_custom.
	(fm_directory_view_activate_file): Get rid of call to the
	athena_file_activate_custom function.
	(set_trash_empty): Rewrote to simplify and fix some path/URI
	confusion.
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (get_icon_text_callback):
	Get rid of use of athena_link_get_display_name.
	
	* src/athena-property-browser.c:
	(athena_property_browser_drag_data_get), (remove_background),
	(remove_emblem), (emblem_image_file_changed),
	(add_background_to_browser), (emblem_dialog_clicked),
	(make_properties_from_directory): Use
	athena_get_uri_from_local_path instead of just sticking a
	"file://" prefix on.
	(get_xml_path): Use athena_make_path instead of just sticking
	a "/" between the two pieces.

	* data/top/Computer.link:
	* data/top/Services.link:

	* libathena-extensions/athena-graphic-effects.c,h:
	(stretch_frame_image), (athena_embed_image_in_frame):

	called athena_embed_image_in_frame to make the thumbnail frame;
	also, added the aa flag to various routines and respected it, using
	a different name and frame for the anti-aliased versions.
	
	* icons/Makefile.am:
	* icons/thumbnail_frame.png:

	Finished task 1793 (Display hierarchical pre-canned set of bookmarks)

	There's now a "static_bookmarks.xml" file that gets installed into
	the Athena data directory. Its contents are parsed into menu items
	that appear above the user's dynamic items. The static items can
	include hierarchy and separators. I put in silly content; someone

	static bookmarks file if found.
	(create_menu_item_from_node): New function, creates a menu item
	from an xml node, recursing into folders.
	(append_static_bookmarks): New function, reads xml document and
	starts the menu-item-creation recursion.
	(athena_window_initialize_bookmarks_menu): Now calls
	append_static_bookmarks before handling the dynamic ones.

	* src/athena-window-private.h: New last_static_bookmark_path field

	* libathena-extensions/athena-search-uri.c:
	(athena_search_uri_to_simple_search_criteria):
	This needs to return a g_free'able string, so I changed the
	placeholder to return NULL instead of "". (g_strdup ("") would
	also have been OK.)

	(athena_switchable_search_bar_set_location):
	Got rid of set_search_controls since set_location does exactly the
	same thing. Changed to use get_location in the
	AthenaNavigationBar base class instead of having lots of
	separate get_location. Fixed bug where get_location would return a
	non-g_strdup'd string, which callers would then g_free. Also
	changed to use simpler version of location_changed since the
	navigation bar can now get the location easily for itself so the
	subclasses need not do it. Callbacks now can call
	athena_navigation_bar_location_changed directly. Removed some
	empty destroy functions in classes where they are likely to be
	empty forever.
	
	* src/athena-window.c: (goto_uri_callback): Whitespace.

	Minor change in athena-clean.sh so that it will kill

	haven't upgraded to the latest, greatest gconf won't 
	have problems.

2000-07-27  Josh Barrow  <linuxfan@ionet.net>

	Changed the athena-clean.sh script to match the name of
	the new gconf daemon.  (gconfd-0.6)

2000-07-27  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Changed "Customize % Settings" to "Edit % Settings" to reduce
	the confusion about the two "Customize" menu items. This matches
	(one little bit of) Arlo's menu-layout proposal.

	* src/athena-window-menus.c: 

	(get_customize_user_level_settings_menu_string): Corrected the
	spelling of this function (had three consecutive t's)
	(clear_dynamic_bookmark_items): Renamed this from

	for appended bookmarks that aren't dynamic.

	(refresh_bookmarks_menu), (refresh_go_menu),

	Did a part of 1063 - "The right click desktop menu needs more commands
	to match gmc" that is not covered by a separate bug - added a "New
	Folder" menu item.
	Fixes 1065 and 1067.
	
	* src/file-manager/dfos-xfer-progress-dialog.c:
	(create_titled_label), (dfos_xfer_progress_dialog_initialize):
	Complete task 1504 - Copy progress dialog needs a visual redesign.
	Made it so that the Copying:, From: and To: lines are packed more
	snugly, as per the design. The spacing of the original GtkLabels
	was too spacy.
	Used a non-zero border to offset the items more from the dialog edges
	to make it look more as designed.

	Redid the complex search bar to look the way we actually

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-async.c:
	(metafile_read_failed): First cut at only reading the metafile if the

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory.c:
	(athena_directory_is_search_directory): Fixed backwards test that

	* src/file-manager/fm-cdrom-extensions.h:
	New file that has constants defined in <linux/cdrom.h>
	I added this to solve many problems that people are
	running into with both Mathieu's fix and the old way
	of including the kernel header.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	It makes me sad to do this, because Matheiu worked so hard
	to fix this, but I created a new file with the CDROM constants
	in them.  This solves several problems people have.  I wish
	there was a beter solution, because now we have to make
	sure we are in sync with the kernel header constants.

2000-07-26  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	* src/file-manager/dfos-xfer.c: (handle_xfer_vfs_error):

	(get_attribute_from_column): Added a missing case to prevent a
	crash, but had to put in a FIXME since the code isn't really working.
	
	* src/athena-application.c: (athena_application_startup):
	Fixed bug where you wouldn't see error messages on startup.  Also
	improved one of the error messages by adding some blank lines.

	It needs some clean-up, which Susan will do soon.
	
2000-07-25  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	reorganized the menus.  There's now a user level menu, which uses
	the current user level symbol as its title, to feedback the
	current level.  There is no longer a settings menu; the rest of
	the stuff in the settings menu was moved to the bottom of the
	edit menu.  We probably want to tweak the order of items some more,
	but this mostly complete now.
	
	Note: you need to get a new bonobo to see the user level symbol
	in the menu title.

	* src/athena-window-menus.c: (user_level_customize_callback),
	(customize_callback), (help_menu_about_athena_callback),

	changed the path of some menu items
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.h:
	changed the path of some menu items
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c:
	(fm_icon_view_create_background_context_menu_items),
	(fm_icon_view_merge_menus):

	* icons/Makefile.am:
	* icons/novice-selected.png:
	* icons/intermediate-selected.png:
	* icons/expert-selected.png:

	use in the menu to indicate selection.
	
	* icons/eazel/i-regular.xml:
	tweaked the text rectangles for the standard document icon in
	the eazel theme.

2000-07-25  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Note: this requires the latest gnome-vfs changes to compile.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file.c:
	(set_owner_and_group): Pass GNOME_VFS_FILE_INFO_DEFAULT
	for get_file_info options.
	(set_owner_and_group_callback): Added new_info parameter to
	match GnomeVFS API change; use this parameter to update
	permissions when owner/group changes, since in some cases
	chown affects permissions.
	(athena_file_set_permissions): Pass GNOME_VFS_FILE_INFO_DEFAULT
	for get_file_info options.
	(set_permissions_callback): Added new_info parameter to match
	GnomeVFS API change; use this parameter to update ctime when
	permissions change (fixes bug 1453 -- changing permissions
	doesn't update permissions-changed date)
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_activate_file): Improved a comment to mention
	an existing bug number.

2000-07-25  Pavel Cisler <pavel@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-drag.c:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-drag.h:
	(athena_drag_default_drop_action_for_icons), (drag_motion_callback):
	Work around a bug in gtk-dnd.c that was making it impossible to
	force a move when dragging in between two volumes - the default
	is copy in that case and holding down Control would force it to
	be a copy too.
	The fix I did is only correct for icon drags, changed the routine
	name to reflect that better.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-dnd.c:
	(athena_icon_container_get_drop_action):
	Fix a typo bug that caused the non-default drop action to be 
	undefined for non-icon drags.

2000-07-25  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-property-browser.c: (category_clicked_callback),

	(get_iso9660_volume_name), (get_ext2_volume_name):
	More work on desktop volume mounting.  Added symbolic link
	cleanup in destroy function.  Symbolic mount links are also
	verified when a new volume mount is detected.

2000-07-25  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	First simple cut at addressing 1469 (clicking on executables
	does not run them). Now it does, which works great for GUI-type
	executables but is pretty lame for command-line ones.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: 
	(file_is_launchable): New utility function, returns true if
	file is executable and not a directory.
	(compute_menu_item_info): Disable "Open in New Window" if
	there's only one item selected and it's executable, since in
	this case "Open" and "Open in New Window" would have the same
	behavior and thus the choice is confusing.
	(fm_directory_view_activate_file): If file is launchable,
	launch it directly instead of looking for another app/viewer to use.
	The user can still use "Open With" to open it differently.

2000-07-25  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	reworked the zoom control to make it themable.  It now gets its pieces from
	three separate images, for flexible theming.  It's not watching the

	The build was completely wasted if you did a make uninstall,
	since the libtrilobite.h changes hadn't been made to all the libs
	using it. This should fix it. I now need to check, if it uses the
	installer or local .h files after a make install.

	* components/help/help-method.c:
	(transform_absolute_file): Changed some stuff to fit Eazel style
	guidelines. Fixed a couple of places that should use 'temp_file2'
	instead of 'temp_file' (this prolly fixes a leak too).
	(file_from_path): New function - returns the filename with no suffix
	from a given path.
	(transform_relative_file): Filled in this function. This fixed bug
	#698 (i18n)
	(help_uri_to_string): Make NULL the last argument to g_strconcat since
	that is the required behavior (otherwise mem-corruption)
	(convert_file_to_uri): Modified to match Eazel style guidelines.
	Removed erroneous mime-type comparison for SGML files. Changed the
	check for 'info' from a 'strncmp' to a 'strcmp'.

	Also removed the FIXME's for bug #696 and #698

	other important flags, including -g and various -W*.

	* src/athena-window.c: (athena_window_initialize_class),
	(athena_window_constructed),
	(athena_window_get_base_page_index), (athena_window_show):
	Overode show function with athena_window_show.  We need
	to do this so we can first call the parents show and then 
	show/hide window widgets based on the users prefs.  We need
	to do this because GnomeDockItems do not get their parent
	assigned until show is called on them.

	* components/help/help-method.c:
	(help_uri_to_string):
	Cleaned it up to fit Eazel style guidelines. Changed the URI's so they
	pass the mime-type to pipe and are escaped. Fixes bug #698.

	I also removed a lot of #ifdef DEBUG_ALI cruft left lying around.

2000-07-19  Raph Levien  <raph@acm.org>

	I have added tentative support for building rsvg with
	freetype2. At this point, only test-rsvg has the freetype
	dependency. Thus, if things break, it should be easy enough to
	work around. My current thinking is to add the dependency
	throughout by replacing existing top-builddir relative ldadd's of
	librsvg.la with a newly defined $(RSVG_LIBS) variable. This
	variable will be defined in configure.in to include both freetype
	and librsvg. Hopefully, I'll check that in tomorrow morning.

	* configure.in: added cut-n-paste-code/freetype/Makefile output.

	* cut-n-paste-code/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Added freetype subdir.

	(trilobite_passwordquery_set_prompt):
	Added the trilobite_passwordquery interface and
	trilobite_passwordquery_client. You add the _passwordquery
	interface to your service, and the client (view or cli tool)
	registers a _passwordquery_client object. When you then execute a
	service function that requires eg. root acces, the service can
	access a TrilobiteRootHelper (accessible using gtk_object_get_data
	(... "trilobite-root-helper"...), and call it. This will emit a
	signal, that will cause the _passwordquery to ask the
	_passwordquery_client for a password. Currently, if no
	_passwordquery_client is set, it will popup a gui input box. But
	we should loose then when Robey does the gtk interface to be used
	in views and cli tools.

	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/trilobite-service.c:
	(trilobite_service_add_interface):
	Added the trilobite_service_add_interface. All trilobite
	interfaces should have one to handle the
	bonobo_object_add_interface ond other magic stuff.

	(impl_Trilobite_Eazel_Sample_list_it), (sample_service_get_epv):
	Added a list_it call, that given a dir does a ls on it. (proof of
	concept stuff).	So I've also added the trilobite_passwordquery
	interface to the sampleservice, and the cli tool tries to do an
	ls -lart /root (thus triggering a password query).

	Pached to work with the trilobite_passwordquery stuff. So as user,
	you can now set the time if you've got the root password.

	This closes 946, 938 and fixes root problem for the installer.

	* components/history/athena-history-view.c:
	(history_load_location), (history_button_press),
	(history_button_release), (make_obj):
	Removed drag move from list. Changed navigation to occur on mouse
	up, not on select row. This is because select row is called on
	rows during a drag. This can be annoying if you are trying to drag
	a row item and Athena is navigating to the item you ared
	dragging over. This behavior happens even if we are not supporting
	drag move of items. Now navigation occurs on the mouse up.

	(Calling it a druid is so lame, who are we kidding?)

	* src/athena-view-frame.c:

	cleanup.

	expires.
	Renamed and reworked the click/drag state machine a bit.

	information over CORBA.

	* libathena/athena-view-component.idl:

	history information.  This sequence contains

	(make_obj), (main):
	Changes in the way that the history list is maintained.
	We now use the info that is received by asking the view frame
	for history information.

	(athena_icon_container_get_drop_action):
	Fix a problem that I introduced with my recent change to 
	drag&drop - colors, background images, etc would no longet
	get accepted in the icon view.
	Made athena_icon_container_get_drop_action only check
	the selection list and the drop target if the dragged data
	is a file operation drag&drop.

2000-07-06  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	removed.
	* src/athena-sidebar.c: (athena_sidebar_initialize),
	(athena_sidebar_activate_panel),
	(athena_sidebar_deactivate_panel),
	(athena_sidebar_update_buttons):

	Muy work. Worked around orbit-idl's shortcommings, by packing the
	dependency trees for the (un)install_failed callbacks into
	xml. Uninstall now does the upwards traversel to detect packages
	that will break. Still not the downwards though. Installing a
	packge using the filename no longer results in a query for the
	file to the server, although we still download all missing deps.

	Most of the corbafication stuff is done.
	
	* athena-installer/src/Makefile:

	* libathena-extensions/athena-file-utilities.c:
	(athena_get_user_main_directory):
	use gnome_vfs_xfer instead of a 'cp' command to install the
	novice home directory.  This fixes bug 1285.
	
2000-06-30  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	eliminated the separate toolbar icon theme; instead it's
	incorporated into the general theming mechanism
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.h:
	got rid of ATHENA_PREFERENCES_TOOLBAR_ICON_THEME
	* libathena-extensions/athena-global-preferences.c:
	(global_preferences_create_dialog),

	* libathena-extensions/bonobo-stream-vfs.c:
	(create_bonobo_stream_vfs):
	A fix to make the setting of the vepv work.  The extern
	vepv is gone, so we now use the allocator functions.

2000-06-30  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-background.c:
	(athena_background_draw):
	fixed bug where the combine mode implemented last night wasn't
	working for normal drawables by setting the fake CanvasBuf flags
	properly.  Now the sidebar in the arlo theme is working.
	
2000-06-30  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>
	
	* acconfig.h: Added masses of undefs for the wrapping
		function ( as mentioned down ).

	* configure.in: If a Bzip2 is found, define the Bzip2
		wrapping functions vie AC_DEFINE to get it into
		 config.h, so the rpm-component and the other
		  Bzip2-based components should now compile with
		   the new Bzip2 versions without problems.

2000-06-29  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	Fixed some memory leaks.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-mime-actions.c:
	(athena_mime_get_short_list_components_for_uri):
	Fix a leaked string.

	* src/athena-zoom-control.c:
	(athena_zoom_control_set_preferred_zoom_levels):
	Fix a leaky setter call.

	Tweak the parameters a bit to print more leaks.

2000-06-29  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* components/tree/Makefile.am: Add VFS_CFLAGS

	* components/tree/main.c (main): Initialize more libraries.
	
	* components/tree/athena-tree-view.h,
	components/tree/athena-tree-view.c: Many changes. The upshot is
	that basic tree loading now works, but many details remain to be
	fleshed out (individual bugs were filed on these).

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-async.c:
	(dequeue_pending_idle_callback), (directory_load_done): Try to
	emit done signal exactly once when a monitor load is complete. But
	I think this might be questionable, see below.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-private.h,
	libathena-extensions/athena-directory.h,
	libathena-extensions/athena-directory.c: Add the
	"done_loading" signal for when a load initiated by monitoring is
	done. I just realized this does the wrong thing when more than one
	thing is monitoring at the same time (both get the signal), so
	maybe it should be changed to a callback function passed to
	athena_file_monitor_add, but that would be harder to implement.

	(athena_directory_emit_done_loading): Function so the async code
	can emit it.

	compiler which is needed by the mozilla preferences C wrapper.
	
2000-06-29  Ali Abdin <aliabdin@aucegypt.edu

	* components/help/Makefile.am: Install the libvfs-help.so module
	in the right place. Closes Bug #919. (will not work though
	if Athena prefix != gnome-vfs prefix (unless a fix goes into
	gnome-vfs))

	* components/websearch/ntl-web-search.c:
	(web_search_populate_engines): Fix to make it look in the right
	place (WEB_SEARCH_DATADIR "/standard.eng" instead of

	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-dnd.c:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-drag.c:

	* src/athena-simple-search-bar.h:
	Updated so that the search location

2000-06-28  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Made the view-failure-handling code only execute

	for _connect_view, which no longer did anything other than
	call through.
	* src/athena-window-manage-views.c:
	(athena_window_view_failed): Renamed from
	"athena_window_view_destroyed" since it's (now) only

	(athena_window_load_content_view): Replaced 
	_connect_content_view with _connect_view.

2000-06-27  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	* components/rpmview/Makefile.am:
	Added components/services/trilobite to the includes in order for a
	clean build to find some header files.

2000-06-27  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Finished task 461 (bookmarks to "Bad URI" should have
	an icon). I picked arbitrary existing icons (gnome foot
	for "generic bookmark", gnome-foot-question-mark for
	"bookmark with known-bad URI"); Arlo and/or Susan will
	have to come up with real ones. I'll write a separate
	bug report about that.

	* icons/i-bookmark.png:
	* icons/i-bookmark-20.png:
	* icons/i-bookmark-missing.png:
	* icons/i-bookmark-missing-20.png: New icons to use
	for bookmarks. I supplied the base size and the 20
	pixel size because that's the one used in menus, where
	bookmarks usually appear. These need to be replaced with
	better images.
	
	* icons/Makefile.am: Add new icons to installed set.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-bookmark.h,
	* libathena-extensions/athena-bookmark.c:
	(athena_bookmark_uri_known_not_to_exist): New public
	function, moved some code from elsewhere to encapsulate this.
	(athena_bookmark_set_icon_to_default): Choose between the
	generic and bad-URI icon if there's no better icon.

	* src/athena-window-menus.c: (activate_bookmark_in_menu_item):
	Now calls athena_bookmark_uri_known_not_to_exist instead
	of doing the work here.

2000-06-27  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	* components/services/startup/athena-view/Makefile.am:
	Fixing gnome-vfs header bustage.

2000-06-26  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* components/services/install/lib/Makefile.am:
	automake, beautifull and yet so nasty. Orbit-idl fix again.

2000-06-26  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* helper-utilities/authenticate/Makefile.am:
	Seems that libathena-extensions dep on libathena that dep on
	bonobo, thus this needed BONOBO_LIBS as well.

2000-06-26  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* components/services/time/service/Makefile.am:
	* components/services/install/command-line/Makefile.am:
	* components/services/install/server/Makefile.am:
	* components/services/trilobite/sample/service/Makefile.am:
	And suddenly the bonobo libs went *poof*

2000-06-26  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* components/services/install/lib/libeazelinstall.h:
	Missed a file.
	
2000-06-26  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* components/Makefile.am:
	Rearranged so libeazelinstall is built before rpmview

	* components/rpmview/Makefile.am:

	(get_search_url_for_package):
	* components/services/install/server/Makefile.am:
	* components/services/install/server/main.c:
	Changed the object destroction scheme, so eazel_install_callback
	now unrefs and destroys the bonobo object.
	
	* components/services/trilobite/sample/lib/Makefile.am:
	Fixed to pass make dist
		
	* athena-installer/src/Makefile:
	* athena-installer/src/Makefile.am:
	Patching so it works with the new installer libs (and still some
	stroking because of the static stuff)
	
	* athena.spec.in:
	* po/POTFILES.in:
	* test/Makefile.am:
	Slice and dice so make dist and rpm -ta works again.

2000-06-26  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/athena-sidebar.c: (athena_sidebar_update_info):
	fixed sidebar background theming by adding a gtk_signal_block_by_func
	call (and the corresponding unblock) when we set up the background
	in update_info, so the new background data isn't written out to the
	metafile, since no explicit change was made.

	(impl_Athena_ZoomableFrame_report_zoom_level_changed),

	Added report_zoom_parameters_changed to the zoomable
	interface. This allows the zoom control to get min/max
	from the zoomable (as opposed to hard coding in values)
	Also fixed the zoom control to now use just doubles.
	Renamed the zoom_level_changed message to be report_zoom_level_changed
	in accordance with convention.

2000-06-26  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Finished task 876 (owner and group should be changeable

	(finish_adding_new_icons), (finish_adding_new_icons_callback),
	(athena_icon_container_add): Replaced old idle code with
	something specific to adding new icons. This does the proper
	layout for manual as well as automatic layout cases.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-background.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-background.c:

	* components/music/Makefile.am:
	* components/music/mp3head.c,h: (extractI4), (is_mphead), (is_xhead),
	(get_bitrate), (get_samprate), (get_mpgver):
	* components/music/mp3head.h:
	integrated Erik Gustavsson's patch to support variable bit rate
	file properly in the music view.
	* components/music/athena-music-view.c: (is_mp3_file),
	(strip_trailing_blanks), (read_id_tag), (extract_number),
	(fetch_song_info):
	fixed bug 1281, music view should use mime types instead of
	extensions, by using the mime type in is_mp3_file.  Also, cleaned
	up Erik's patch for removing trailing blanks and integrated it.
	
2000-06-26  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* HACKING: Move bonobo after gnome-vfs since it now
	depends on it for bonobo-storage-vfs.c to build.
	
2000-06-26  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libathena-extensions/athena-directory-metafile.c:
	(set_metadata_eat_value): Fixed use of hash table in here. The
	old code would destroy the wrong key. (Thanks to Ian for pointing
	that when you insert a value into GHashTable it keeps the old key
	instead of overwriting with the new one.)

2000-06-26  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* components/services/install/command-line/.cvsignore:

	Ignore some additional generated files.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-gnome-extensions.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-gnome-extensions.c:
	Moved stock dialog functions to athena-stock-dialogs.[ch].
	(athena_gnome_canvas_item_request_update_deep),
	(athena_gnome_canvas_request_update_all),
	(athena_gnome_canvas_set_scroll_region),
	(athena_gnome_canvas_set_scroll_region_left_justify):

	AthenaIconContainer.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-gtk-extensions.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-gtk-extensions.c:
	(athena_gtk_adjustment_set_value),

	same way scroll bars do, taking the page size into account.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-horizontal-splitter.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-horizontal-splitter.c:
	(athena_horizontal_splitter_initialize),
	(toggle_splitter_position),
	(athena_horizontal_splitter_button_press),
	(athena_horizontal_splitter_button_release):
	Fixed logic so that splitter will only open or close if you both
	click and release within the splitter itself.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-private.h:
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-container.c:
	(icon_toggle_selected): Move icons to front when they are selected.
	(set_scroll_region): Moved workaround that sets scroll region to
	be large enough to fill the widget allocation into a function in
	athena-gnome-extensions.h. In the process, I fixed the problem
	where it would do the job wrong when the view was zoomed.
	(lay_down_icons), (relayout), (reload_icon_positions):
	Started work on sharing code between automatic layout of the entire
	container and layout of new icons as the arrive.
	(athena_icon_container_clear), (athena_icon_container_add):
	Got started on the mechanism for laying out new icons as they arrive
	in bunches instead of one at a time.

	(athena_yes_no_dialog_parented):
	Moved all the stock dialog code in here.
	
	* src/athena-sidebar-title.c: (update_icon): Only display the
	icon when it's ready, instead of showing generic document icon
	before that time.
	(update_title), (update_more_info), (update_emblems),
	(update_notes): Added FIXMEs about doing the same with other info.
	(athena_sidebar_title_button_press_event): Added a FIXME to the
	half-baked code in here.

2000-06-26  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	of the ./configure process.
	
	* helper-utilities/authenticate/athena-authenticate.h:
	Include <stdlib.h> for compiling with -Werror without error.
	
2000-06-26  Pavel Cisler <pavel@eazel.com>

	* acconfig.h:
	* configure.in:
	Fix build breakage caused recent changes to make GnomeVFS compile
	without OAF support. Some GnomeVFS headers now require USING_OAF
	to be defined and when included from Athena, this define was
	missing. Not sure this is the 100% correct way to do this but
	this should at least prevent people from being stuck with a broken
	build.

2000-06-26  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	Added XML-based theme mechanism and used it for the sidebar
	background, which isn't entirely working yet.

	file, and reload them when the theme changes.

	* libathena-extensions/athena-link.c:
	(free_icon_notification_info), (icon_read_done_callback),
	(is_remote_uri), (athena_link_get_image_uri):
	Linksets now use gnome-vfs to load load icons over http instead of
	ghttp, using Darin's new utility routines.  Also, made it load
	them asynchronously.
	
	* libathena-extensions/athena-icon-factory.c:
	(athena_icon_factory_get_pixbuf_for_icon):
	Made get_pixbuf_for_icon set the custom boolean when it calls
	get_icon_from_cache if necessary.
	
2000-06-25  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>
	
	* ChangeLog: This is the fresh one.
	* ChangeLog-20000625: Split up the ChangeLog.
